It is widely employed as a canonical model to study clustering and community detection, and provides generally a fertile ground to study the statistical and computational tradeoffs that arise in network and data sciences. This note surveys the recent developments that establish the fundamental limits for community detection in the SBM, both with respect to information-theoretic and computational thresholds, and for various recovery requirements such as exact, partial and weak recovery (a.k.a., detection). The main results discussed are the phase transitions for exact recovery at the Chernoff-Hellinger threshold, the phase transition for weak recovery at the Kesten- Stigum threshold, the optimal distortion-SNR tradeoff for partial recovery, the learning of the SBM parameters and the gap between information-theoretic and computational thresholds. The note also covers some of the algorithms developed in the quest of achieving the limits, in particular two-round algorithms via graph-splitting, semi-definite programming, linearized belief propagation, classical and nonbacktracking spectral methods. A few open problems are also discussed.},

In each chapter, informal discussions of questions that give analysis its inherent fascination are followed by precise, but not overly formal, developments of the techniques needed to make sense of ~them. By focusing on the unifying themes of approximation and the resolution of paradoxes that arise in the transition from the finite to the infinite, the text turns what could be a daunting cascade of definitions and theorems into a coherent and engaging progression of ideas. Acutely aware of the need for rigor, the student is much better prepared to understand what constitutes a proper mathematical proof and how to write one.Fifteen years of classroom experience with the first edition of Understanding Analysis have solidified and refined the central narrative of the second edition. Roughly 150 new exercises join a selection of the best exercises from the first edition, and three more project-style sections have been added. Investigations of Euler's computation of {$\zeta$}(2), the Weierstrass Approximation \- Theorem, and the gamma function are now among the book's cohort of seminal results serving as motivation and payoff for the beginning student to master the methods of analysis.},

Monitoring changes in the covariance matrix of a multivariate process is often used for monitoring process variability under the assumption that only a few elements in the covariance matrix are changed simultaneously from the in-control values. The existing LASSO-based covariance monitoring charts in the high-dimensional settings provide good performance in detecting some shift patterns depending on the prespecified tuning parameter. In practice, control charts that perform reasonably well over various shift patterns are desired when shift patterns are unknown. In this article, we propose a control chart based on an adaptive LASSO-thresholding for monitoring changes in the covariance matrix. The performance of the proposed chart, which is called the ALT-norm chart, is evaluated for various shift patterns and compared with the existing penalized likelihood-based methods. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed chart. Finally, we illustrate the advantages of the ALT-norm chart through simulated and real data from both the semiconductor industry and a high-dimensional milling process.},

  doi = {10.1007/978-0-387-92298-0},
  abstract = {There has been a dramatic growth in the development and application of Bayesian inferential methods. Some of this growth is due to the availability of powerful simulation-based algorithms to summarize posterior distributions. There has been also a growing interest in the use of the system R for statistical analyses. R's open source nature, free availability, and large number of contributor packages have made R the software of choice for many statisticians in education and industry. Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian modeling by the use of computation using the R language. The early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace's method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples. This book is a suitable companion book for an introductory course on Bayesian methods and is valuable to the statistical practitioner who wishes to learn more about the R language and Bayesian methodology. The LearnBayes package, written by the author and available from the CRAN website, contains all of the R functions described in the book. The second edition contains several new topics such as the use of mixtures of conjugate priors and the use of Zellner's g priors to choose between models in linear regression. There are more illustrations of the construction of informative prior distributions, such as the use of conditional means priors and multivariate normal priors in binary regressions. The new edition contains changes in the R code illustrations according to the latest edition of the LearnBayes package. Jim Albert is Professor of Statistics at Bowling Green State University. He is Fellow of the American Statistical Association and is past editor of The American Statistician. His books include Ordinal Data Modeling (with Val Johnson), Workshop Statistics: Discovery with Data, A Bayesian Approach (with Allan Rossman), and Bayesian Computation using Minitab.},

  abstract = {Why are some countries rich and others poor? In 1500, the income differences were small, but they have grown dramatically since Columbus reached America. Since then, the interplay between geography, globalization, technological change, and economic policy has determined the wealth and poverty of nations. The industrial revolution was Britain's path breaking response to the challenge of globalization. Western Europe and North America joined Britain to form a club of rich nations by pursuing four polices-creating a national market by abolishing internal tariffs and investing in transportation, erecting an external tariff to protect their fledgling industries from British competition, banks to stabilize the currency and mobilize domestic savings for investment, and mass education to prepare people for industrial work.  Together these countries pioneered new technologies that have made them ever richer. Before the Industrial Revolution, most of the world's manufacturing was done in Asia, but industries from Casablanca to Canton were destroyed by western competition in the nineteenth century, and Asia was transformed into 'underdeveloped countries' specializing in agriculture. The spread of economic development has been slow since modern technology was invented to fit the needs of rich countries and is ill adapted to the economic and geographical conditions of poor countries. A few countries - Japan, Soviet Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and perhaps China - have, nonetheless, caught up with the West through creative responses to the technological challenge and with Big Push industrialization that has achieved rapid growth through investment coordination. Whether other countries can emulate the success of East Asia is a challenge for the future.

Current methods to quantify it are often heuristic, make strong assumptions on the label sets across the tasks, and many are architecture-dependent, relying on task-specific optimal parameters (e.g., require training a model on each dataset). In this work we propose an alternative notion of distance between datasets that (i) is model-agnostic, (ii) does not involve training, (iii) can compare datasets even if their label sets are completely disjoint and (iv) has solid theoretical footing. This distance relies on optimal transport, which provides it with rich geometry awareness, interpretable correspondences and well-understood properties. Our results show that this novel distance provides meaningful comparison of datasets, and correlates well with transfer learning hardness across various experimental settings and datasets.},

The traditional approach to a ?rst course in measure theory, such as in Royden (1988), is to teach the Lebesgue measure on the real line, then the p di?erentation theorems of Lebesgue, L -spaces on R, and do general m- sure at the end of the course with one main application to the construction of product measures. This approach does have the pedagogic advantage of seeing one concrete case ?rst before going to the general one. But this also has the disadvantage in making many students' perspective on m- sure theory somewhat narrow. It leads them to think only in terms of the Lebesgue measure on the real line and to believe that measure theory is intimately tied to the topology of the real line. As students of statistics, probability, physics, engineering, economics, and biology know very well, there are mass distributions that are typically nonuniform, and hence it is useful to gain a general perspective. This book attempts to provide that general perspective right from the beginning. The opening chapter gives an informal introduction to measure and integration theory. It shows that the notions of ?-algebra of sets and countable additivity of a set function are dictated by certain very na- ral approximation procedures from practical applications and that they are not just some abstract ideas.},

A pseudolikelihood ratio test statistic, which measures the distance between the nonparametric and the parametric models, is derived as a ratio of quadratic forms. The distribution of this statistic under the null hypothesis of linearity is calculated numerically by using Johnson curves.

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

We further extend the SSGL to sparse generalized additive models (GAMs), thereby introducing the first nonparametric variant of the spike-and-slab lasso methodology. Our model simultaneously performs group selection and estimation, while our fully Bayes treatment of the mixture proportion allows for model complexity control and automatic self-adaptivity to different levels of sparsity. We develop theory to uniquely characterize the global posterior mode under the SSGL and introduce a highly efficient block coordinate ascent algorithm for maximum a posteriori estimation. We further employ de-biasing methods to provide uncertainty quantification of our estimates. Thus, implementation of our model avoids the computational intensiveness of Markov chain Monte Carlo in high dimensions. We derive posterior concentration rates for both grouped linear regression and sparse GAMs when the number of covariates grows at nearly exponential rate with sample size. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through extensive simulations and data analysis. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {High-dimensional data sets have become ubiquitous in the past few decades, often with many more covariates than observations. In the frequentist setting, penalized likelihood methods are the most popular approach for variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional data. In the Bayesian framework, spike-and-slab methods are commonly used as probabilistic constructs for high-dimensional modeling. Within the context of linear regression, Rockova and George (2018) introduced the spike-and-slab LASSO (SSL), an approach based on a prior which provides a continuum between the penalized likelihood LASSO and the Bayesian point-mass spike-and-slab formulations. Since its inception, the spike-and-slab LASSO has been extended to a variety of contexts, including generalized linear models, factor analysis, graphical models, and nonparametric regression. The goal of this paper is to survey the landscape surrounding spike-and-slab LASSO methodology. First we elucidate the attractive properties and the computational tractability of SSL priors in high dimensions. We then review methodological developments of the SSL and outline several theoretical developments. We illustrate the methodology on both simulated and real datasets.},

  abstract = {Clinical attachment level (CAL) is regarded as the most popular measure to assess periodontal disease (PD). These probed tooth-site level measures are usually rounded and recorded as whole numbers (in mm) producing clustered (site measures within a mouth) error-prone ordinal responses representing some ordering of the underlying PD progression. In addition, it is hypothesized that PD progression can be spatially-referenced, i.e., proximal tooth-sites share similar PD status in comparison to sites that are distantly located. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian multivariate probit framework for these ordinal responses where the cut-point parameters linking the observed ordinal CAL levels to the latent underlying disease process can be fixed in advance. The latent spatial association characterizing conditional independence under Gaussian graphs is introduced via a nonparametric Bayesian approach motivated by the probit stick-breaking process, where the components of the stick-breaking weights follows a multivariate Gaussian density with the precision matrix distributed as G-Wishart. This yields a computationally simple, yet robust and flexible framework to capture the latent disease status leading to a natural clustering of tooth-sites and subjects with similar PD status (beyond spatial clustering), and improved parameter estimation through sharing of information. Both simulation studies and application to a motivating PD dataset reveal the advantages of considering this flexible nonparametric ordinal framework over other alternatives.},

  abstract = {Summary. With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.},

However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, typically on the order of n3 where n is the number of data points, in performing the necessary matrix inversions. For large datasets, storage and processing also lead to computational bottlenecks, and numerical stability of the estimates and predicted values degrades with increasing n. Various methods have been proposed to address these problems, including predictive processes in spatial data analysis and the subset-of-regressors technique in machine learning. The idea underlying these approaches is to use a subset of the data, but this raises questions concerning sensitivity to the choice of subset and limitations in estimating fine-scale structure in regions that are not well covered by the subset. Motivated by the literature on compressive sensing, we propose an alternative approach that involves linear projection of all the data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace. We demonstrate the superiority of this approach from a theoretical perspective and through simulated and real data examples.},

Such ideas play at least three roles. First they may give simple approximate answers to distributional problems where an exact solution is known in principle but difficult to implement. The second role is to yield higher-order expansions from which the accuracy of simple approximations may be assessed and where necessary improved. Thirdly the systematic development of a theoretical approach to statistical inference that will apply to quite general families of statistical models demands an asymptotic formulation, as far as possible one that will recover 'exact' results where these are available. The approximate arguments are developed by supposing that some defining quantity, often a sample size but more generally an amount of information, becomes large: it must be stressed that this is a technical device for generating approximations whose adequacy always needs assessing, rather than a 'physical' limiting notion. Of the three roles outlined above, the first two are quite close to the traditional roles of asymptotic expansions in applied mathematics and much ofthe very extensive literature on the asymptotic expansion of integrals and of the special functions of mathematical physics is quite directly relevant, although the recasting of these methods into a probability mould is quite often enlightening.},

Applications include the Black\textendash Scholes formula for the pricing of derivatives in financial mathematics, the Kalman\textendash Bucy filter used in the US space program and also theoretical applications to partial differential equations and analysis. Short, readable chapters aim for clarity rather than full generality. More than 350 exercises are included to help readers put their new-found knowledge to the test and to prepare them for tackling the research literature.},

  abstract = {This book covers those basic topics which usually form the core of intermediate courses in statistical theory; it is largely about estima\- tion and hypothesis testing. It is intended for undergraduates following courses in statistics but is also suitable preparatory read\- ing for some postgraduate courses. It is assumed that the reader has completed an introductory course which covered probability, random variables, moments and the sampling distributions. The level of mathematics required does not go beyond first year calculus. In case the reader has not acquired much facility in handling matrices, the results in least squares estimation are first obtained directly and then given an (optional) matrix formulation. If techniques for changing from one set of variables to another have not been met, then the appendix on these topics should be studied first. The same appendix contains essential discussion of the order statistics which are frequently used for illustrative purposes. Introductory courses usually include the elements of hypothesis testing and of point and interval estimation though the treatment must perforce become rather thin since at that stage it is difficult to provide adequate justifications for some procedures-plausible though they may seem. This text discusses these important topics in considerable detail, starting from scratch. The level is nowhere advanced and proofs of asymptotic results are omitted. Methods deriving from the Bayesian point of view are gradually introduced and alternate with the more usual techniques.},

A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate \$t\$. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

We discuss some difficulties arising in the approximation of these estimators and illustrate their behavior in several numerical experiments.

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become a popular approach to overcome this issue, in which one simulates synthetic data sets given parameters and compares summaries of these data sets with the corresponding observed values. We propose to avoid the use of summaries and the ensuing loss of information by instead using the Wasserstein distance between the empirical distributions of the observed and synthetic data. This generalizes the well-known approach of using order statistics within ABC to arbitrary dimensions. We describe how recently developed approximations of the Wasserstein distance allow the method to scale to realistic data sizes, and propose a new distance based on the Hilbert space-filling curve. We provide a theoretical study of the proposed method, describing consistency as the threshold goes to zero while the observations are kept fixed, and concentration properties as the number of observations grows. Various extensions to time series data are discussed. The approach is illustrated on various examples, including univariate and multivariate g-and-k distributions, a toggle switch model from systems biology, a queueing model, and a L\textbackslash 'evy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor.

Such applications require models that yield clusters whose sizes grow sublinearly with the total number of data points\textemdash the microclustering property. Motivated by these issues, we propose a general class of random partition models that satisfy the microclustering property with well-characterized theoretical properties. Our proposed models overcome major limitations in the existing literature on microclustering models, namely a lack of interpretability, identifiability, and full characterization of model asymptotic properties. Crucially, we drop the classical assumption of having an exchangeable sequence of data points, and instead assume an exchangeable sequence of clusters. In addition, our framework provides flexibility in terms of the prior distribution of cluster sizes, computational tractability, and applicability to a large number of microclustering tasks. We establish theoretical properties of the resulting class of priors, where we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the number of clusters and of the proportion of clusters of a given size. Our framework allows a simple and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to perform statistical inference. We illustrate our proposed methodology on the microclustering task of ER, where we provide a simulation study and real experiments on survey panel data.},

We propose a multiplicative gamma process shrinkage prior on the factor loadings which allows introduction of infinitely many factors, with the loadings increasingly shrunk towards zero as the column index increases. We use our prior on a parameter-expanded loading matrix to avoid the order dependence typical in factor analysis models and develop an efficient Gibbs sampler that scales well as data dimensionality increases. The gain in efficiency is achieved by the joint conjugacy property of the proposed prior, which allows block updating of the loadings matrix. We propose an adaptive Gibbs sampler for automatically truncating the infinite loading matrix through selection of the number of important factors. Theoretical results are provided on the support of the prior and truncation approximation bounds. A fast algorithm is proposed to produce approximate Bayes estimates. Latent factor regression methods are developed for prediction and variable selection in applications with high-dimensional correlated predictors. Operating characteristics are assessed through simulation studies, and the approach is applied to predict survival times from gene expression data. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.},

The book presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible.

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

A draw from the beta process yields an infinite collection of probabilities in the unit interval, and a draw from the Bernoulli process turns these into binary-valued features. Recent work has provided stick-breaking representations for the beta process analogous to the well-known stick-breaking representation for the Dirichlet process. We derive one such stick-breaking representation directly from the characterization of the beta process as a completely random measure. This approach motivates a three-parameter generalization of the beta process, and we study the power laws that can be obtained from this generalized beta process. We present a posterior inference algorithm for the beta-Bernoulli process that exploits the stick-breaking representation, and we present experimental results for a discrete factor-analysis model.},

We also pay special attention to non-Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, mini-batches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

  abstract = {Comparing probability distributions is an indispensable and ubiquitous task in machine learning and statistics. The most common way to compare a pair of Borel probability measures is to compute a metric between them, and by far the most widely used notions of metric are the Wasserstein metric and the total variation metric. The next most common way is to compute a divergence between them, and in this case almost every known divergences such as those of Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, R\textbackslash 'enyi, and many more, are special cases of the \$f\$-divergence. Nevertheless these metrics and divergences may only be computed, in fact, are only defined, when the pair of probability measures are on spaces of the same dimension. How would one measure, say, a Wasserstein distance between the uniform distribution on the interval \$[-1,1]\$ and a Gaussian distribution on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^3\$? We will show that various common notions of metrics and divergences can be extended in a completely natural manner to Borel probability measures defined on spaces of different dimensions, e.g., one on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^m\$ and another on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^n\$ where \$m, n\$ are distinct, so as to give a meaningful answer to the previous question.},

A common strategy is to use a mixture of Poissons, which unfortunately is quite restrictive in not accounting for distributions having variance less than the mean. Other approaches include mixing multinomials, which requires finite support, and using a Dirichlet process prior with a Poisson base measure, which does not allow smooth deviations from the Poisson. As a broad class of alternative models, we propose to use nonparametric mixtures of rounded continuous kernels. An efficient Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation, and a simulation study is performed to assess performance. Focusing on the rounded Gaussian case, we generalize the modeling framework to account for multivariate count data, joint modeling with continuous and categorical variables, and other complications. The methods are illustrated through applications to a developmental toxicity study and marketing data. This article has .},

We introduce a functional-to-functional autoregressive model that is used to forecast future demand/offer functions, and estimate the model via the minimization of a penalized mean squared error of prediction, with a penalty term based on the Hilbert\textendash Schmidt squared norm of autoregressive lagged operators. The approach is of general interest and could be generalized to any situation in which one has to deal with functions that are subject to the above constraints which evolve over time.},

We propose a multiscale Bernstein polynomial family of priors, which produce smooth realizations that do not rely on hard partitioning of the support. At each level in an infinitely-deep binary tree, we place a beta dictionary density; within a scale the densities are equivalent to Bernstein polynomials. Using a stick-breaking characterization, stochastically decreasing weights are allocated to the finer scale dictionary elements. A slice sampler is used for posterior computation, and properties are described. The method characterizes densities with locally-varying smoothness, and can produce a sequence of coarse to fine density estimates. An extension for Bayesian testing of group differences is introduced and applied to DNA methylation array data.},

But a single EWMA chart cannot perform well for small and large shifts simultaneously. Furthermore, in the worst-case situation, this scheme requires a few observations to overcome its initial inertia. The main goal of this article is to suggest an adaptive EWMA (AEWMA) chart that weights the past observations of the monitored process using a suitable function of the current "error." The resulting scheme can be viewed as a smooth combination of a Shewhart chart and an EWMA chart. A design procedure for the new control schemes is suggested. Comparisons of the standard and worst-case average run length profiles of the new scheme with those of different control charts show that AEWMA schemes offer a more balanced protection against shifts of different sizes.},

In particular, we develop a control chart for Phase II monitoring which integrates the least angle regression algorithm with a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average. Comparisons with related multivariate control schemes demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control chart in a wide range of practical applications, including profile and multistage process monitoring. Further, the proposed scheme may also provide valuable diagnostic information for fault isolation. Supplemental materials, including an R package, are available online.},

Most Phase I control charts are based on the assumption of normally distributed observations. However, distribution-free methods appear to be ideal candidates for Phase I applications. Indeed, because little information is available, it is difficult to validate a distributional assumption in Phase I or at least at its beginning stage. In addition, as has been noted in the literature, this assumption cannot be checked before process stability is established. In this article, we propose a new distribution-free Phase I procedure for univariate observations. The suggested method, based on recursive segmentation and permutation, detects single or multiple mean and/or scale shifts. A simulation study shows that our method compares favorably with parametric control charts when the process is normally distributed and performs better than other nonparametric control charts when the process distribution is skewed or heavy tailed.

The usual approach consists in computing the limits so that the in-control run-length distribution has some desired properties; for example, a prescribed mean. However, as a consequence of the increasing complexity of process data, the run-length of many control charts discussed in the recent literature can be studied only through simulation. Furthermore, in some scenarios, such as profile and autocorrelated data monitoring, the limits cannot be tabulated in advance, and when different charts are combined, the control limits depend on a multidimensional vector of parameters. In this article, we propose the use of stochastic approximation methods for control chart calibration and discuss enhancements for their implementation (e.g., the initialization of the algorithm, an adaptive choice of the gain, a suitable stopping rule for the iterative process, and the advantages of using multicore workstations). Examples are used to show that simulated stochastic approximation provides a reliable and fully automatic approach for computing the control limits in complex applications.

  abstract = {Projection predictive inference is a decision theoretic Bayesian approach that decouples model estimation from decision making. Given a reference model previously built including all variables present in the data, projection predictive inference projects its posterior onto a constrained space of a subset of variables. Variable selection is then performed by sequentially adding relevant variables until predictive performance is satisfactory. Previously, projection predictive inference has been demonstrated only for generalized linear models (GLMs) and Gaussian processes (GPs) where it showed superior performance to competing variable selection procedures. In this work, we extend projection predictive inference to support variable and structure selection for generalized linear multilevel models (GLMMs) and generalized additive multilevel models (GAMMs). Our simulative and real-word experiments demonstrate that our method can drastically reduce the model complexity required to reach reference predictive performance and achieve good frequency properties.},

Day-by-day, hour-by-hour evaluation of the evolution of online ideas and opinion allows observers and scholars to monitor trends and momentum in public opinion well before traditional polls. However, there are difficulties in recording and analyzing often brief, unverified comments while the unequal age, gender, social and racial representation among social media users can produce inaccurate forecasts of final polls. Reviewing the different techniques employed using social media to nowcast and forecast elections, this book assesses its achievements and limitations while presenting a new technique of "sentiment analysis" to improve upon them. The authors carry out a meta-analysis of the existing literature to show the conditions under which social media-based electoral forecasts prove most accurate while new case studies from France, the United States and Italy demonstrate how much more accurate "sentiment analysis" can prove.},

The cross-tabulation of opinions is possible with iSA thanks to its stability.

  abstract = {Entity resolution identifies and removes duplicate entities in large, noisy databases and has grown in both usage and new developments as a result of increased data availability. Nevertheless, entity resolution has tradeoffs regarding assumptions of the data generation process, error rates, and computational scalability that make it a difficult task for real applications. In this paper, we focus on a related problem of unique entity estimation, which is the task of estimating the unique number of entities and associated standard errors in a data set with duplicate entities. Unique entity estimation shares many fundamental challenges of entity resolution, namely, that the computational cost of all-to-all entity comparisons is intractable for large databases. To circumvent this computational barrier, we propose an efficient (near-linear time) estimation algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing. Our estimator, under realistic assumptions, is unbiased and has provably low variance compared to existing random sampling based approaches. In addition, we empirically show its superiority over the state-of-the-art estimators on three real applications. The motivation for our work is to derive an accurate estimate of the documented, identifiable deaths in the ongoing Syrian conflict. Our methodology, when applied to the Syrian data set, provides an estimate of \$191,874 \textbackslash pm 1772\$ documented, identifiable deaths, which is very close to the Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) estimate of 191,369. Our work provides an example of challenges and efforts involved in solving a real, noisy challenging problem where modeling assumptions may not hold.},

To be robust to the process distribution, the spatial sign statistic that defines the multivariate direction of an observation is used to construct a Shewhart-type control chart for detecting out-of-control observations in historical phase I data. The proposed control chart is distribution free in the sense that the false-positive rate (or false alarm rate), the proportion of wrongly classified in-control samples, can be controlled at the specified value for elliptical-direction distributions. In addition, we demonstrate through simulation studies that the false-positive rate of the proposed chart is robust to the shift size of the out-of-control condition if we only delete the most extreme out-of-control observation at each iteration of phase I analysis. Compared with the traditional Hotelling's T2 control chart and some of its robust versions, the proposed chart is generally more powerful in detecting out-of-control observations and more robust to the normality assumption.

The estimate of the matrix of bivariate regression functions is consistent in the sense of the multi-dimensional Gram\textendash Schmidt norm and is asymptotically normally distributed. The prediction intervals of the multivariate random trajectories are available for predictive inference. We show the finite sample performance of mFLR by a simulation study and illustrate the method through predicting multivariate traffic flow trajectories for up-to-date and partially observed traffic streams.},

Effectively, BART is a nonparametric Bayesian regression approach which uses dimensionally adaptive random basis elements. Motivated by ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular, BART is defined by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood. This approach enables full posterior inference including point and interval estimates of the unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model-free variable selection. BART's many features are illustrated with a bake-off against competing methods on 42 different data sets, with a simulation experiment and on a drug discovery classification problem.},

These methods have become a staple for the sequential analysis of data in such diverse fields as signal processing, epidemiology, machine learning, population ecology, quantitative finance, and robotics.The coverage is comprehensive, ranging from the underlying theory to computational implementation, methodology, and diverse applications in various areas of science. This is achieved by describing SMC algorithms as particular cases of a general framework, which involves concepts such as Feynman-Kac distributions, and tools such as importance sampling and resampling. This general framework is used consistently throughout the book.Extensive coverage is provided on sequential learning (filtering, smoothing) of state-space (hidden Markov) models, as this remains an important application of SMC methods. More recent applications, such as parameter estimation of these models (through e.g. particle Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques) and the simulation of challenging probability distributions (in e.g. Bayesian inference or rare-event problems), are also discussed.The book may be used either as a graduate text on Sequential Monte Carlo methods and state-space modeling, or as a general reference work on the area. Each chapter includes a set of exercises for self-study, a comprehensive bibliography, and a ``Python corner,'' which discusses the practical implementation of the methods covered. In addition, the book comes with an open source Python library, which implements all the algorithms described in the book, and contains all the programs that were used to perform the numerical experiments.},

The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called ``Divide-and-Conquer''), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide.},

However, standard Bayesian algorithms to sample from the posterior require that the likelihood function, the probability density of the data given the parameter represented as a function of the parameter for fixed observed data, is computationally tractable. However, there are an increasing number of models across Science and Technology where the likelihood function is difficult or impossible to compute. When simulation from the model is comparatively cheaper, a class of likelihood-free methods called approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can be used. However, ABC introduces an approximation to the posterior. This article gives an introduction to ABC, describes the approximation behavior of ABC, and provides advice on the successful implementation of ABC. Some current challenges facing ABC methods are also discussed.},

The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible and are capable of handling a much wider range of problems than the main analytical system currently in use for time series analysis, the Box-Jenkins ARIMA system. Additions to this second edition include the filtering of nonlinear and non-Gaussian series. Part I of the book obtains the mean and variance of the state, of a variable intended to measure the effect of an interaction and of regression coefficients, in terms of the observations. Part II extends the treatment to nonlinear and non-normal models. For these, analytical solutions are not available so methods are based on simulation.},

With Rcpp, the transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and high-performance statistical computing is finally accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School of Management "Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp" is simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of ManagementThe Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- S\o ren H\o jsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark "Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++.Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a contributor to CRAN for over a decade and maintains around twenty packages. He is the Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for R and other quantitative software, edits the CRAN Task Views for Finance and High-Performance Computing, is a co-founder of the annual R/Finance conference, and an editor of the Journal of Statistical Software.

A new method avoids possible speed penalties in R by using the Rcpp extension package in conjunction with the Armadillo C++~matrix library. In addition to the inherent performance advantages of compiled code, Armadillo provides an easy-to-use template-based meta-programming framework, allowing the automatic pooling of several linear algebra operations into one, which in turn can lead to further speedups. With the aid of Rcpp and Armadillo, conversion of linear algebra centred algorithms from R to C++~becomes straightforward. The algorithms retain the overall structure as well as readability, all while maintaining a bidirectional link with the host R environment. Empirical timing comparisons of R and C++~implementations of a Kalman filtering algorithm indicate a speedup of several orders of magnitude.},

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference.

This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the ``hardness'' of scientific research\textemdash i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors\textemdash is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a ``positive'' (full or partial) or ``negative'' support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in ``softer'' sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

In fact, as discussed in recent literature, bypassing this trade-off is still an open problem which is object of intense research. To cover this gap, we develop a novel variational approximation for the posterior distribution of the coefficients in high-dimensional probit regression with Gaussian priors. Our method leverages a representation with global and local variables but, unlike for classical mean-field assumptions, it avoids a fully factorized approximation, and instead assumes a factorization only for the local variables. We prove that the resulting variational approximation belongs to a tractable class of unified skew-normal densities that crucially incorporates skewness and, unlike for state-of-the-art variational Bayes solutions, converges to the exact posterior density as the number of predictors p goes to infinity. To solve the variational optimization problem, we develop a tractable coordinate ascent variational algorithm which easily scales to p in tens of thousands, and provably requires a number of iterations converging to 1 as p goes to infinity. These findings are also illustrated in extensive simulation studies and in real-world medical applications where our methods are shown to uniformly improve classical mean-field variational Bayes in terms of inference accuracy and predictive performance. The magnitude of such gains is especially remarkable in those high-dimensional p{$>$}n settings where state-of-the-art alternative strategies are computationally impractical.},

In the first method, the certainty of the GP model prediction is used to indicate the presence of seizures. In the second approach, the hyperparameters of the GP model are used. Tests are carried out with a feature set of ten EEG measures developed from various signal processing techniques. Features are evaluated using a neural network classifier on 51 h of real neonatal EEG. The GP measures, in particular, the prediction certainty approach, produce a high level of performance compared to other modeling methods and methods currently in clinical use for EEG analysis, indicating that they are an important and useful tool for the real-time detection of neonatal seizures.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to statistical problems, though fruitful in many ways, has been rather unsuccessful in treating nonparametric problems. This is due primarily to the difficulty in finding workable prior distributions on the parameter space, which in nonparametric ploblems is taken to be a set of probability distributions on a given sample space. There are two desirable properties of a prior distribution for nonparametric problems. (I) The support of the prior distribution should be large--with respect to some suitable topology on the space of probability distributions on the sample space. (II) Posterior distributions given a sample of observations from the true probability distribution should be manageable analytically. These properties are antagonistic in the sense that one may be obtained at the expense of the other. This paper presents a class of prior distributions, called Dirichlet process priors, broad in the sense of (I), for which (II) is realized, and for which treatment of many nonparametric statistical problems may be carried out, yielding results that are comparable to the classical theory. In Section 2, we review the properties of the Dirichlet distribution needed for the description of the Dirichlet process given in Section 3. Briefly, this process may be described as follows. Let \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$ be a space and \$\textbackslash mathscr\{A\}\$ a \$\textbackslash sigma\$-field of subsets, and let \$\textbackslash alpha\$ be a finite non-null measure on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$. Then a stochastic process \$P\$ indexed by elements \$A\$ of \$\textbackslash mathscr\{A\}\$, is said to be a Dirichlet process on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$ with parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$ if for any measurable partition \$(A\_1, \textbackslash cdots, A\_k)\$ of \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$, the random vector \$(P(A\_1), \textbackslash cdots, P(A\_k))\$ has a Dirichlet distribution with parameter \$(\textbackslash alpha(A\_1), \textbackslash cdots, \textbackslash alpha(A\_k)). P\$ may be considered a random probability measure on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$, The main theorem states that if \$P\$ is a Dirichlet process on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$ with parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$, and if \$X\_1, \textbackslash cdots, X\_n\$ is a sample from \$P\$, then the posterior distribution of \$P\$ given \$X\_1, \textbackslash cdots, X\_n\$ is also a Dirichlet process on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$ with a parameter \$\textbackslash alpha + \textbackslash sum\^n\_1 \textbackslash delta\_\{x\_i\}\$, where \$\textbackslash delta\_x\$ denotes the measure giving mass one to the point \$x\$. In Section 4, an alternative definition of the Dirichlet process is given. This definition exhibits a version of the Dirichlet process that gives probability one to the set of discrete probability measures on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$. This is in contrast to Dubins and Freedman [2], whose methods for choosing a distribution function on the interval [0, 1] lead with probability one to singular continuous distributions. Methods of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1] that with probability one is absolutely continuous have been described by Kraft [7]. The general method of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1], described in Section 2 of Kraft and van Eeden [10], can of course be used to define the Dirichlet process on [0, 1]. Special mention must be made of the papers of Freedman and Fabius. Freedman [5] defines a notion of tailfree for a distribution on the set of all probability measures on a countable space \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$. For a tailfree prior, posterior distribution given a sample from the true probability measure may be fairly easily computed. Fabius [3] extends the notion of tailfree to the case where \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$ is the unit interval [0, 1], but it is clear his extension may be made to cover quite general \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$. With such an extension, the Dirichlet process would be a special case of a tailfree distribution for which the posterior distribution has a particularly simple form. There are disadvantages to the fact that \$P\$ chosen by a Dirichlet process is discrete with probability one. These appear mainly because in sampling from a \$P\$ chosen by a Dirichlet process, we expect eventually to see one observation exactly equal to another. For example, consider the goodness-of-fit problem of testing the hypothesis \$H\_0\$ that a distribution on the interval [0, 1] is uniform. If on the alternative hypothesis we place a Dirichlet process prior with parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$ itself a uniform measure on [0, 1], and if we are given a sample of size \$n \textbackslash geqq 2\$, the only nontrivial nonrandomized Bayes rule is to reject \$H\_0\$ if and only if two or more of the observations are exactly equal. This is really a test of the hypothesis that a distribution is continuous against the hypothesis that it is discrete. Thus, there is still a need for a prior that chooses a continuous distribution with probability one and yet satisfies properties (I) and (II). Some applications in which the possible doubling up of the values of the observations plays no essential role are presented in Section 5. These include the estimation of a distribution function, of a mean, of quantiles, of a variance and of a covariance. A two-sample problem is considered in which the Mann-Whitney statistic, equivalent to the rank-sum statistic, appears naturally. A decision theoretic upper tolerance limit for a quantile is also treated. Finally, a hypothesis testing problem concerning a quantile is shown to yield the sign test. In each of these problems, useful ways of combining prior information with the statistical observations appear. Other applications exist. In his Ph. D. dissertation [1], Charles Antoniak finds a need to consider mixtures of Dirichlet processes. He treats several problems, including the estimation of a mixing distribution, bio-assay, empirical Bayes problems, and discrimination problems.},

  abstract = {This paper is about detecting activations in statistical parametric maps and considers the relative sensitivity of a nested hierarchy of tests that we have framed in terms of the level of inference (voxel level, cluster level, and set level). These tests are based on the probability of obtaining c, or more, clusters with k, or more, voxels, above a threshold u. This probability has a reasonably simple form and is derived using distributional approximations from the theory of Gaussian fields. The most important contribution of this work is the notion of set-level inference. Set-level inference refers to the statistical inference that the number of clusters comprising an observed activation profile is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. This inference pertains to the set of activations reaching criteria and represents a new way of assigning P values to distributed effects. Cluster-level inferences are a special case of set-level inferences, which obtain when the number of clusters c = 1. Similarly voxel-level inferences are special cases of cluster-level inferences that result when the cluster can be very small (i.e., k = 0). Using a theoretical power analysis of distributed activations, we observed that set-level inferences are generally more powerful than cluster-level inferences and that cluster-level inferences are generally more powerful than voxel-level inferences. The price paid for this increased sensitivity is reduced localizing power: Voxel-level tests permit individual voxels to be identified as significant, whereas cluster-and set-level inferences only allow clusters or sets of clusters to be so identified. For all levels of inference the spatial size of the underlying signal f (relative to resolution) determines the most powerful thresholds to adopt. For set-level inferences if f is large (e.g., fMRI) then the optimum extent threshold should be greater than the expected number of voxels for each cluster. If f is small (e.g., PET) the extent threshold should be small. We envisage that set-level inferences will find a role in making statistical inferences about distributed activations, particularly in fMRI.},

This book covers the best-known spatial models for three types of spatial data: geostatistical data (stationarity, intrinsic models, variograms, spatial regression and space-time models), areal data (Gibbs-Markov fields and spatial auto-regression) and point pattern data (Poisson, Cox, Gibbs and Markov point processes). The level is relatively advanced, and the presentation concise but complete. The most important statistical methods and their asymptotic properties are described, including estimation in geostatistics, autocorrelation and second-order statistics, maximum likelihood methods, approximate inference using the pseudo-likelihood or Monte-Carlo simulations, statistics for point processes and Bayesian hierarchical models. A chapter is devoted to Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (Gibbs sampler, Metropolis-Hastings algorithms and exact simulation).A large number of real examples are studied with R, and each chapter ends with a set of theoretical and applied exercises. While a foundation in probability and mathematical statistics is assumed, three appendices introduce some necessary background. The book is accessible to senior undergraduate students with a solid math background and Ph.D. students in statistics. Furthermore, experienced statisticians and researchers in the above-mentioned fields will find the book valuable as a mathematically sound reference.

Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

  abstract = {Decisions in statistical data analysis are often justified, criticized or avoided by using concepts of objectivity and subjectivity. We argue that the words `objective' and `subjective' in statistics discourse are used in a mostly unhelpful way, and we propose to replace each of them with broader collections of attributes, with objectivity replaced by transparency, consensus, impartiality and correspondence to observable reality, and subjectivity replaced by awareness of multiple perspectives and context dependence. Together with stability, these make up a collection of virtues that we think is helpful in discussions of statistical foundations and practice. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgement of multiple perspectives as complementary goals. We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling and socio-economic stratification. The aim of the paper is to push users and developers of statistical methods towards more effective use of diverse sources of information and more open acknowledgement of assumptions and goals.},

These methods, however, often manifest a key conceptual tension in prior modeling: a model encoding true prior information should be chosen without reference to the model of the measurement process, but almost all common prior modeling techniques are implicitly motivated by a reference likelihood. In this paper we resolve this apparent paradox by placing the choice of prior into the context of the entire Bayesian analysis, from inference to prediction to model evaluation.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

It is about using regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online.

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in network analysis is clustering the nodes into groups which share a similar connectivity pattern. Existing algorithms for community detection assume the knowledge of the number of clusters or estimate it a priori using various selection criteria and subsequently estimate the community structure. Ignoring the uncertainty in the first stage may lead to erroneous clustering, particularly when the community structure is vague. We instead propose a coherent probabilistic framework for simultaneous estimation of the number of communities and the community structure, adapting recently developed Bayesian nonparametric techniques to network models. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed which obviates the need to perform reversible jump MCMC on the number of clusters. The methodology is shown to outperform recently developed community detection algorithms in a variety of synthetic data examples and in benchmark real-datasets. Using an appropriate metric on the space of all configurations, we develop nonasymptotic Bayes risk bounds even when the number of clusters is unknown. Enroute, we develop concentration properties of nonlinear functions of Bernoulli random variables, which may be of independent interest in analysis of related models.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

The effective application of Bayesian variable selection methods for regression with these datasets has proved difficult since available Markov chain Monte Carlo methods do not perform well in typical problem sizes of interest. We propose new adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to address this shortcoming. The adaptive design of these algorithms exploits the observation that in large-\$p\$, small-\$n\$ settings, the majority of the \$p\$ variables will be approximately uncorrelated a posteriori. The algorithms adaptively build suitable nonlocal proposals that result in moves with squared jumping distance significantly larger than standard methods. Their performance is studied empirically in high-dimensional problems and speed-ups of up to four orders of magnitude are observed.},

To analyze the bivariate data on related survival times (e.g., matched pairs experiments, twin or family data) the shared frailty models were suggested. Shared frailty models are used despite their limitations. To overcome their disadvantages correlated frailty models may be used. In this article, we introduce the gamma correlated frailty models with two different baseline distributions namely, the generalized log logistic, and the generalized Weibull. We introduce the Bayesian estimation procedure using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to estimate the parameters involved in these models. We present a simulation study to compare the true values of the parameters with the estimated values. Also we apply these models to a real life bivariate survival dataset related to the kidney infection data and a better model is suggested for the data.},

PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\%).

  abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10\textendash 30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

Unlike a standard mixture model which assumes that each data point belongs to one and only one mixture component, or cluster, a partial membership model allows data points to have fractional membership in multiple clusters. Algorithms which assign data points partial memberships to clusters can be useful for tasks such as clustering genes based on microarray data (Gasch \& Eisen, 2002). Our Bayesian Partial Membership Model (BPM) uses exponential family distributions to model each cluster, and a product of these distibtutions, with weighted parameters, to model each datapoint. Here the weights correspond to the degree to which the datapoint belongs to each cluster. All parameters in the BPM are continuous, so we can use Hybrid Monte Carlo to perform inference and learning. We discuss relationships between the BPM and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Mixed Membership models, Exponential Family PCA, and fuzzy clustering. Lastly, we show some experimental results and discuss nonparametric extensions to our model.},

This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

  abstract = {This book provides a compact self-contained introduction to the theory and application of Bayesian statistical methods. The book is accessible to readers having a basic familiarity with probability, yet allows more advanced readers to quickly grasp the principles underlying Bayesian theory and methods. The examples and computer code allow the reader to understand and implement basic Bayesian data analyses using standard statistical models and to extend the standard models to specialized data analysis situations. The book begins with fundamental notions such as probability, exchangeability and Bayes' rule, and ends with modern topics such as variable selection in regression, generalized linear mixed effects models, and semiparametric copula estimation. Numerous examples from the social, biological and physical sciences show how to implement these methodologies in practice. Monte Carlo summaries of posterior distributions play an important role in Bayesian data analysis. The open-source R statistical computing environment provides sufficient functionality to make Monte Carlo estimation very easy for a large number of statistical models and example R-code is provided throughout the text. Much of the example code can be run ``as is'' in R, and essentially all of it can be run after downloading the relevant datasets from the companion website for this book. Peter Hoff is an Associate Professor of Statistics and Biostatistics at the University of Washington. He has developed a variety of Bayesian methods for multivariate data, including covariance and copula estimation, cluster analysis, mixture modeling and social network analysis.

  abstract = {Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) are non-parametric models that can capture complex exogenous variable effects. In any regression problem, it is often of interest to learn which variables are most active. Variable activity in BART is usually measured by counting the number of times a tree splits for each variable. Such one-way counts have the advantage of fast computations. Despite their convenience, one-way counts have several issues. They are statistically unjustified, cannot distinguish between main effects and interaction effects, and become inflated when measuring interaction effects. An alternative method well-established in the literature is Sobol' indices, a variance-based global sensitivity analysis technique. However, these indices often require Monte Carlo integration, which can be computationally expensive. This paper provides analytic expressions for Sobol' indices for BART posterior samples. These expressions are easy to interpret and are computationally feasible. Furthermore, we will show a fascinating connection between first-order (main-effects) Sobol' indices and one-way counts. We also introduce a novel ranking method, and use this to demonstrate that the proposed indices preserve the Sobol'-based rank order of variable importance. Finally, we compare these methods using analytic test functions and the En-ROADS climate impacts simulator.},

The performance of the functional linear regression model depends on the number of principal components used. We therefore introduce a consistent robust model selection procedure to choose the number of principal components. Our robust functional linear regression model can be used alongside an outlier detection procedure to effectively identify abnormal functional responses. A simulation study shows our method is able to effectively capture the regression behavior in the presence of outliers, and is able to find the outliers with high accuracy. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on jet engine sensor data.

In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject.},

In this approach, causal effects are comparisons of such potential outcomes. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for a particular subject. The authors discuss how randomized experiments allow us to assess causal effects and then turn to observational studies. They lay out the assumptions needed for causal inference and describe the leading analysis methods, including matching, propensity-score methods, and instrumental variables.

Examples of random measures that have this characterization include the Dirichlet process, its two-parameter extension, the two-parameter Poisson\textendash Dirichlet process, finite dimensional Dirichlet priors, and beta two-parameter processes. The rich nature of stick-breaking priors offers Bayesians a useful class of priors for nonparametric problems, while the similar construction used in each prior can be exploited to develop a general computational procedure for fitting them. In this article we present two general types of Gibbs samplers that can be used to fit posteriors of Bayesian hierarchical models based on stick-breaking priors. The first type of Gibbs sampler, referred to as a P\'olya urn Gibbs sampler, is a generalized version of a widely used Gibbs sampling method currently employed for Dirichlet process computing. This method applies to stick-breaking priors with a known P\'olya urn characterization, that is, priors with an explicit and simple prediction rule. Our second method, the blocked Gibbs sampler, is based on an entirely different approach that works by directly sampling values from the posterior of the random measure. The blocked Gibbs sampler can be viewed as a more general approach because it works without requiring an explicit prediction rule. We find that the blocked Gibbs avoids some of the limitations seen with the P\'olya urn approach and should be simpler for nonexperts to use.},

These results provide a better understanding of models and have both theoretical and practical applications. To facilitate the use of our models we generalize the work in Brunner, Chan, James and Lo (2001) by extending their weighted Chinese restaurant (WCR) Monte Carlo procedure, an i.i.d. sequential importance sampling (SIS) procedure for approximating posterior mean functionals based on the Dirichlet process, to the case of approximation of mean functionals and additionally their posterior laws in species sampling mixture models. We also discuss collapsed Gibbs sampling, P\'olya urn Gibbs sampling and a P\'olya urn SIS scheme.

In such circumstances, it is convenient to use a graphical model to represent the statistical dependencies, via a set of connected "modules", each relating to a specific data modality, and drawing on specific domain expertise in their development. In principle, given data, the conventional statistical update then allows for coherent uncertainty quantification and information propagation through and across the modules. However, misspecification of any module can contaminate the estimate and update of others, often in unpredictable ways. In various settings, particularly when certain modules are trusted more than others, practitioners have preferred to avoid learning with the full model in favor of approaches that restrict the information propagation between modules, for example by restricting propagation to only particular directions along the edges of the graph. In this article, we investigate why these modular approaches might be preferable to the full model in misspecified settings. We propose principled criteria to choose between modular and full-model approaches. The question arises in many applied settings, including large stochastic dynamical systems, meta-analysis, epidemiological models, air pollution models, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics, and causal inference with propensity scores.},

  abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

The most frequently used type of Bayesian graphical models are Bayesian networks. The structural part of a Bayesian graphical model is a graph consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes represent variables, which may be either discrete or continuous. An edge between two nodes A and B indicates a direct influence between the state of A and the state of B, which in some domains can also be interpreted as a causal relation. The widespread use of Bayesian networks is largely due to the availability of efficient inference algorithms for answering probabilistic queries about the states of the variables in the network. Furthermore, to support the construction of Bayesian network models, learning algorithms are also available. We give an overview of the Bayesian network formalism and some of the algorithmic developments in the area.},

  abstract = {This article presents an exposition and synthesis of the theory and some applications of the so-called indirect method of inference. These ideas have been exploited in the field of econometrics, but less so in other fields such as biostatistics and epidemiology. In the indirect method, statistical inference is based on an intermediate statistic, which typically follows an asymptotic normal distribution, but is not necessarily a consistent estimator of the parameter of interest. This intermediate statistic can be a naive estimator based on a convenient but misspecified model, a sample moment or a solution to an estimating equation. We review a procedure of indirect inference based on the generalized method of moments, which involves adjusting the naive estimator to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The objective function of this procedure is shown to be interpretable as an ``indirect likelihood'' based on the intermediate statistic. Many properties of the ordinary likelihood function can be extended to this indirect likelihood. This method is often more convenient computationally than maximum likelihood estimation when handling such model complexities as random effects and measurement error, for example, and it can also serve as a basis for robust inference and model selection, with less stringent assumptions on the data generating mechanism. Many familiar estimation techniques can be viewed as examples of this approach. We describe applications to measurement error, omitted covariates and recurrent events. A dataset concerning prevention of mammary tumors in rats is analyzed using a Poisson regression model with overdispersion. A second dataset from an epidemiological study is analyzed using a logistic regression model with mismeasured covariates. A third dataset of exam scores is used to illustrate robust covariance selection in graphical models.},

Many Phase I control charts are based on an implicit assumption of normally distributed process observations. In the beginning stages of process control, little information is available about the process and the normality assumption may not be reasonable. Existing robust and distribution-free control charts are concerned with the establishment of Phase II control limits that are robust to nonnormality or outliers from the Phase I sample. Our literature review revealed no purely distribution-free Phase I control-chart methods. We propose a distribution-free method for defining the in-control state of a process and identifying an in-control reference sample. The resultant reference sample can be used to estimate the process parameters for the Phase II procedure of choice. The proposed rank-based method is compared with the traditional X chart using Monte Carlo simulation. The rank-based method compares favorably to the X chart when the process is normally distributed and performs better than the X chart in many situations when the process distribution is skewed or heavy tailed.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of monitoring the mean of a normally distributed process variable when the objective is to effectively detect both small and large shifts in this mean. The performance of a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) control chart is evaluated, where the likelihood ratio is based on a moving window of past observations. The performance of the GLR chart is compared with the performance of other options, such as combinations of Shewhart and cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts and an adaptive CUSUM chart, that have been proposed for detecting a wide range of shift sizes. Performance is evaluated for sustained shifts, transient shifts, and drifts in the mean. It is shown that the overall performance of the GLR chart is at least as good as these other options. These other options have multiple control-chart parameters that allow for the charts to be tuned to be more sensitive to certain shifts that may be of interest. However, the GLR chart does not require users to specify the values of any control-chart parameters other than the size of the window and the control limit. We recommend a specific window size and provide a table of control limits corresponding to specified values of the false-alarm rate, so it is very easy to design the GLR chart for use in applications. Simulating the performance of the GLR chart is time consuming, but approximating the GLR chart with a set of CUSUM charts provides a much faster way of evaluating the performance of the GLR chart for research purposes.},

Most blockmodels, however, ignore variation in vertex degree, making them unsuitable for applications to real-world networks, which typically display broad degree distributions that can significantly distort the results. Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for community detection using this objective function or its non-degree-corrected counterpart and show that the degree-corrected version dramatically outperforms the uncorrected one in both real-world and synthetic networks.},

Using simulations, the authors find that for a variety of data-generating processes, the proposed BSCMs almost always provide better predictive accuracy and parameter precision than extant SCMs. They demonstrate an application of the proposed BSCMs to a real-world context of a tax imposed on soda sales in Washington state in 2010. As in the simulations, the proposed models outperform extant models, as measured by predictive accuracy in the posttreatment periods. The authors find that the tax led to an increase of 5.7\% in retail price and a decrease of 5.5\%{$\sim$}5.8\% in sales. They also find that retailers in Washington overshifted the tax to consumers, leading to a pass-through rate of approximately 121\%.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The transformation is modeled as unknown for greater distributional flexibility, while the rounding operation ensures a coherent integer-valued data-generating process. An efficient MCMC algorithm is developed for posterior inference and provides a mechanism for adaptation of successful Bayesian models and algorithms for continuous data to the integer-valued data setting. Using the STAR framework, we design a new Bayesian Additive Regression Tree model for integer-valued data, which demonstrates impressive predictive distribution accuracy for both synthetic data and a large healthcare utilization dataset. For interpretable regression-based inference, we develop a STAR additive model, which offers greater flexibility and scalability than existing integer-valued models.

  abstract = {Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian inference. Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult to automate. We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). The user only provides a Bayesian model and a dataset; nothing else. We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We implement ADVI in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan.},

He is a professor in the field of operations research, and his daily activities involve building models of mathematical optimization, developing algorithms for solving the problems, implementing those algorithms using computer programming languages, experimenting with data, etc. Three languages are involved: human language, mathematical language, and computer language. His team of students need to go over three different languages, which requires "translation" among the three languages. As this book was written to teach his research group how to translate, this book will also be useful for anyone who needs to learn how to translate in a similar situation.The Julia Language is as fast as C, as convenient as MATLAB, and as general as Python with a flexible algebraic modeling language for mathematical optimization problems. With the great support from Julia developers, especially the developers of the JuMP\textemdash Julia for Mathematical Programming\textemdash package, Julia makes a perfect tool for students and professionals in operations research and related areas such as industrial engineering, management science, transportation engineering, economics, and regional science.For more information, visit: http://www.chkwon.net/julia},

We propose an accurate, fast, and scalable approach to multiple imputation, which we call MIDAS (Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoders). MIDAS employs a class of unsupervised neural networks known as denoising autoencoders, which are designed to reduce dimensionality by corrupting and attempting to reconstruct a subset of data. We repurpose denoising autoencoders for multiple imputation by treating missing values as an additional portion of corrupted data and drawing imputations from a model trained to minimize the reconstruction error on the originally observed portion. Systematic tests on simulated as well as real social science data, together with an applied example involving a large-scale electoral survey, illustrate MIDAS's accuracy and efficiency across a range of settings. We provide open-source software for implementing MIDAS.},

Besides numerous applications in statistics, optimization, and imaging, the MM principle finds wide applications in large scale machine learning problems such as matrix completion, discriminant analysis, and nonnegative matrix factorizations. When applied to nonconvex optimization problems, MM algorithms enjoy the advantages of convexifying the objective function, separating variables, numerical stability, and ease of implementation. However, compared to the large body of literature on other optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of MM algorithms is scattered and problem specific. This survey presents a unified treatment of the convergence of MM algorithms. With modern applications in mind, the results encompass non-smooth objective functions and non-asymptotic analysis.},

Two theorems are presented showing that Polya trees can be constructed to concentrate arbitrarily closely about any desired pdf, and that Polya tree priors can put positive mass in every relative entropy neighborhood of every positive density with finite entropy, thereby satisfying a consistency condition. Such theorems are false for Dirichlet processes. Models are constructed combining partially specified Polya trees with other information such as monotonicity or unimodality. It is shown how to compute bounds on posterior expectations over the class of all priors with the given specifications. A numerical example is given. A theorem of Diaconis and Freedman about Dirichlet processes is generalized to Polya trees, allowing Polya trees to be the models for errors in regression problems. Finally, empirical Bayes models using Dirichlet processes are generalized to Polya trees. An example from Berry and Christensen is reanalyzed with a Polya tree model.},

We propose a simple and general posterior interval estimation algorithm to rapidly and accurately estimate quantiles of the posterior distributions for one-dimensional functionals. Our algorithm runs Markov chain Monte Carlo in parallel for subsets of the data, and then averages quantiles estimated from each subset. We provide strong theoretical guarantees and show that the credible intervals from our algorithm asymptotically approximate those from the full posterior in the leading parametric order. Our algorithm has a better balance of accuracy and efficiency than its competitors across a variety of simulations and a real-data example.},

  abstract = {The emerging field of cancer radiomics endeavors to characterize intrinsic patterns of tumor phenotypes and surrogate markers of response by transforming medical images into objects that yield quantifiable summary statistics to which regression and machine learning algorithms may be applied for statistical interrogation. Recent literature has identified clinicopathological association based on textural features deriving from gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) which facilitate evaluations of gray-level spatial dependence within a delineated region of interest. GLCM-derived features, however, tend to contribute highly redundant information. Moreover, when reporting selected feature sets, investigators often fail to adjust for multiplicities and commonly fail to convey the predictive power of their findings. This article presents a Bayesian probabilistic modeling framework for the GLCM as a multivariate object as well as describes its application within a cancer detection context based on computed tomography. The methodology, which circumvents processing steps and avoids evaluations of reductive and highly correlated feature sets, uses latent Gaussian Markov random field structure to characterize spatial dependencies among GLCM cells and facilitates classification via predictive probability. Correctly predicting the underlying pathology of 81\% of the adrenal lesions in our case study, the proposed method outperformed current practices which achieved a maximum accuracy of only 59\%. Simulations and theory are presented to further elucidate this comparison as well as ascertain the utility of applying multivariate Gaussian spatial processes to GLCM objects.},

  abstract = {Cancer radiomics is an emerging discipline promising to elucidate lesion phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity through patterns of enhancement, texture, morphology, and shape. The prevailing technique for image texture analysis relies on the construction and synthesis of Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM). Practice currently reduces the structured count data of a GLCM to reductive and redundant summary statistics for which analysis requires variable selection and multiple comparisons for each application, thus limiting reproducibility. In this article, we develop a Bayesian multivariate probabilistic framework for the analysis and unsupervised clustering of a sample of GLCM objects. By appropriately accounting for skewness and zero-inflation of the observed counts and simultaneously adjusting for existing spatial autocorrelation at nearby cells, the methodology facilitates estimation of texture pattern distributions within the GLCM lattice itself. The techniques are applied to cluster images of adrenal lesions obtained from CT scans with and without administration of contrast. We further assess whether the resultant subtypes are clinically oriented by investigating their correspondence with pathological diagnoses. Additionally, we compare performance to a class of machine-learning approaches currently used in cancer radiomics with simulation studies.},

A standard fMRI study gives rise to massive amounts of noisy data with a complicated spatio-temporal correlation structure. Statistics plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of the data and obtaining relevant results that can be used and interpreted by neuroscientists. In this paper we discuss the analysis of fMRI data, from the initial acquisition of the raw data to its use in locating brain activity, making inference about brain connectivity and predictions about psychological or disease states. Along the way, we illustrate interesting and important issues where statistics already plays a crucial role. We also seek to illustrate areas where statistics has perhaps been underutilized and will have an increased role in the future.},

Examples of these methods include gradient-boosted decision trees, random forests and Bayesian classification and regression trees. Two potential shortcomings of tree ensembles are their lack of smoothness and their vulnerability to the curse of dimensionality. We show that these issues can be overcome by instead considering sparsity inducing soft decision trees in which the decisions are treated as probabilistic. We implement this in the context of the Bayesian additive regression trees framework and illustrate its promising performance through testing on benchmark data sets. We provide strong theoretical support for our methodology by showing that the posterior distribution concentrates at the minimax rate (up to a logarithmic factor) for sparse functions and functions with additive structures in the high dimensional regime where the dimensionality of the covariate space is allowed to grow nearly exponentially in the sample size. Our method also adapts to the unknown smoothness and sparsity levels, and can be implemented by making minimal modifications to existing Bayesian additive regression tree algorithms.},

Our simulation results demonstrate that sharing of information across related model components is often very beneficial, particularly in sparse high-dimensional problems in which variable selection must be conducted. We illustrate our methodology by analyzing medical expenditure data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). To facilitate the Bayesian nonparametric regression analysis, we develop two novel models for analyzing the MEPS data using Bayesian additive regression trees\textemdash a heteroskedastic log-normal hurdle model with a ``shrink-toward-homoskedasticity'' prior and a gamma hurdle model.},

This new edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers an up-to-date account of practical methodology for handling missing data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing data mechanism, and then they apply the theory to a wide range of important missing data problems.Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition starts by introducing readers to the subject and approaches toward solving it. It looks at the patterns and mechanisms that create the missing data, as well as a taxonomy of missing data. It then goes on to examine missing data in experiments, before discussing complete-case and available-case analysis, including weighting methods. The new edition expands its coverage to include recent work on topics such as nonresponse in sample surveys, causal inference, diagnostic methods, and sensitivity analysis, among a host of other topics.  An updated ``classic'' written by renowned authorities on the subject Features over 150 exercises (including many new ones) Covers recent work on important methods like multiple imputation, robust alternatives to weighting, and Bayesian methods Revises previous topics based on past student feedback and class experience Contains an updated and expanded bibliography  The authors were awarded The Karl Pearson Prize in 2017 by the International Statistical Institute, for a research contribution that has had profound influence on statistical theory, methodology or applications.

The algorithm is parallelized using the MapReduce paradigm outlining how the Map and Reduce primitives are implemented.

  abstract = {Current Gibbs sampling schemes in mixture of Dirichlet process (MDP) models are restricted to using "conjugate" base measures that allow analytic evaluation of the transition probabilities when resampling configurations, or alternatively need to rely on approximate numeric evaluations of some transition probabilities. Implementation of Gibbs sampling in more general MDP models is an open and important problem because most applications call for the use of nonconjugate base measures. In this article we propose a conceptual framework for computational strategies. This framework provides a perspective on current methods, facilitates comparisons between them, and leads to several new methods that expand the scope of MDP models to nonconjugate situations. We discuss one in detail. The basic strategy is based on expanding the parameter vector, and is applicable for MDP models with arbitrary base measure and likelihood. Strategies are also presented for the important class of normal-normal MDP models and for problems with fixed or few hyperparameters. The proposed algorithms are easily implemented and illustrated with an application.},

  abstract = {Entity resolution (ER; also known as record linkage or de-duplication) is the process of merging noisy databases, often in the absence of unique identifiers. A major advancement in ER methodology has been the application of Bayesian generative models, which provide a natural framework for inferring latent entities with rigorous quantification of uncertainty. Despite these advantages, existing models are severely limited in practice, as standard inference algorithms scale quadratically in the number of records. While scaling can be managed by fitting the model on separate blocks of the data, such a na\"ive approach may induce significant error in the posterior. In this article, we propose a principled model for scalable Bayesian ER, called ``distributed Bayesian linkage'' or d-blink, which jointly performs blocking and ER without compromising posterior correctness. Our approach relies on several key ideas, including: (i) an auxiliary variable representation that induces a partition of the entities and records into blocks; (ii) a method for constructing well-balanced blocks based on k-d trees; (iii) a distributed partially collapsed Gibbs sampler with improved mixing; and (iv) fast algorithms for performing Gibbs updates. Empirical studies on six datasets\textemdash including a case study on the 2010 Decennial Census\textemdash demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

  abstract = {This Bayesian modeling book is intended for practitioners and applied statisticians looking for a self-contained entry to computational Bayesian statistics. Focusing on standard statistical models and backed up by discussed real datasets available from the book website, it provides an operational methodology for conducting Bayesian inference, rather than focusing on its theoretical justifications. Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior distributions in each case and specific reference solutions are given for each of the models. Similarly, computational details are worked out to lead the reader towards an effective programming of the methods given in the book. While R programs are provided on the book website and R hints are given in the computational sections of the book, The Bayesian Core requires no knowledge of the R language and it can be read and used with any other programming language. The Bayesian Core can be used as a textbook at both undergraduate and graduate levels, as exemplified by courses given at Universit\'e Paris Dauphine (France), University of Canterbury (New Zealand), and University of British Columbia (Canada). It serves as a unique textbook for a service course for scientists aiming at analyzing data the Bayesian way as well as an introductory course on Bayesian statistics. The prerequisites for the book are a basic knowledge of probability theory and of statistics. Methodological and data-based exercises are included within the main text and students are expected to solve them as they read the book. Those exercises can obviously serve as assignments, as was done in the above courses. Datasets, R codes and course slides all are available on the book website. Jean-Michel Marin is currently senior researcher at INRIA, the French Computer Science research institute, and located at Universit\'e Paris-Sud, Orsay. He has previously been Assistant Professor at Universit\'e Paris Dauphine for four years. He has written numerous papers on Bayesian methodology and computing, and is currently a member of the council of the French Statistical Society. Christian Robert is Professor of Statistics at Universit\'e Paris Dauphine and Head of the Statistics Research Laboratory at CREST-INSEE, Paris. He has written over a hundred papers on Bayesian Statistics and computational methods and is the author or co-author of seven books on those topics, including The Bayesian Choice (Springer, 2001), winner of the ISBA DeGroot Prize in 2004.

They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained.

  abstract = {Adam Smith turned economic theory on its head in 1776 when he declared that the pursuit of self-interest mediated by the market itself--not by government--led, via an invisible hand, to the greatest possible welfare for society as a whole. The Hesitant Hand examines how subsequent economic thinkers have challenged or reaffirmed Smith's doctrine, some contending that society needs government to intervene on its behalf when the marketplace falters, others arguing that government interference ultimately benefits neither the market nor society. Steven Medema explores what has been perhaps the central controversy in modern economics from Smith to today. He traces the theory of market failure from the 1840s through the 1950s and subsequent attacks on this view by the Chicago and Virginia schools. Medema follows the debate from John Stuart Mill through the Cambridge welfare tradition of Henry Sidgwick, Alfred Marshall, and A. C. Pigou, and looks at Ronald Coase's challenge to the Cambridge approach and the rise of critiques affirming Smith's doctrine anew. He shows how, following the marginal revolution, neoclassical economists, like the preclassical theorists before Smith, believed government can mitigate the adverse consequences of self-interested behavior, yet how the backlash against this view, led by the Chicago and Virginia schools, demonstrated that self-interest can also impact government, leaving society with a choice among imperfect alternatives. The Hesitant Hand demonstrates how government's economic role continues to be bound up in questions about the effects of self-interest on the greater good.},

However, there exist many real situations where one of the two responses (usually the most interesting for the analysis) is rare. It has been largely reported that this class imbalance heavily compromises the process of learning, because the model tends to focus on the prevalent class and to ignore the rare events. However, not only the estimation of the classification model is affected by a skewed distribution of the classes, but also the evaluation of its accuracy is jeopardized, because the scarcity of data leads to poor estimates of the model's accuracy. In this work, the effects of class imbalance on model training and model assessing are discussed. Moreover, a unified and systematic framework for dealing with the problem of imbalanced classification is proposed, based on a smoothed bootstrap re-sampling technique. The proposed technique is founded on a sound theoretical basis and an extensive empirical study shows that it outperforms the main other remedies to face imbalanced learning problems.},

  abstract = {Statisticians are increasingly posed with thought-provoking and even paradoxical questions, challenging our qualifications for entering the statistical paradises created by Big Data. By developing measures for data quality, this article suggests a framework to address such a question: ``Which one should I trust more: a 1\% survey with 60\% response rate or a self-reported administrative dataset covering 80\% of the population?'' A 5-element Euler-formula-like identity shows that for any dataset of size nnn, probabilistic or not, the difference between the sample average X{$\harrowextender\harrowextender\harrowextender\harrowextender$}nX\textasciimacron n\textbackslash overline\{X\}\_\{n\} and the population average X{$\harrowextender\harrowextender\harrowextender\harrowextender$}NX\textasciimacron N\textbackslash overline\{X\}\_\{N\} is the product of three terms: (1) a data quality measure, {$\rho$}R,X{$\rho$}R,X\textbackslash rho\_\{\{R,X\}\}, the correlation between XjXjX\_\{j\} and the response/recording indicator RjRjR\_\{j\}; (2) a data quantity measure, (N-n)/n---------{$\surd$}(N-n)/n\textbackslash sqrt\{(N-n)/n\}, where NNN is the population size; and (3) a problem difficulty measure, {$\sigma$}X{$\sigma$}X\textbackslash sigma\_\{X\}, the standard deviation of XXX. This decomposition provides multiple insights: (I) Probabilistic sampling ensures high data quality by controlling {$\rho$}R,X{$\rho$}R,X\textbackslash rho\_\{\{R,X\}\} at the level of N-1/2N-1/2N\^\{-1/2\}; (II) When we lose this control, the impact of NNN is no longer canceled by {$\rho$}R,X{$\rho$}R,X\textbackslash rho\_\{\{R,X\}\}, leading to a Law of Large Populations (LLP), that is, our estimation error, relative to the benchmarking rate 1/n-{$\surd$}1/n1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}, increases with N--{$\surd$}N\textbackslash sqrt\{N\}; and (III) the ``bigness'' of such Big Data (for population inferences) should be measured by the relative size f=n/Nf=n/Nf=n/N, not the absolute size nnn; (IV) When combining data sources for population inferences, those relatively tiny but higher quality ones should be given far more weights than suggested by their sizes. Estimates obtained from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the 2016 US presidential election suggest a {$\rho$}R,X{$\approx-$}0.005{$\rho$}R,X{$\approx-$}0.005\textbackslash rho\_\{\{R,X\}\}\textbackslash approx-0.005 for self-reporting to vote for Donald Trump. Because of LLP, this seemingly minuscule data defect correlation implies that the simple sample proportion of the self-reported voting preference for Trump from 1\%1\%1\textbackslash\% of the US eligible voters, that is, n{$\approx$}2,300,000n{$\approx$}2,300,000n\textbackslash approx2\textbackslash mbox\{,\}300\textbackslash mbox\{,\}000, has the same mean squared error as the corresponding sample proportion from a genuine simple random sample of size n{$\approx$}400n{$\approx$}400n\textbackslash approx400, a 99.98\%99.98\%99.98\textbackslash\% reduction of sample size (and hence our confidence). The CCES data demonstrate LLP vividly: on average, the larger the state's voter populations, the further away the actual Trump vote shares from the usual 95\%95\%95\textbackslash\% confidence intervals based on the sample proportions. This should remind us that, without taking data quality into account, population inferences with Big Data are subject to a Big Data Paradox: the more the data, the surer we fool ourselves.},

The field of Bayesian statistics has exploded over the past thirty years and is now an established field of research in mathematical statistics and computer science, a key component of data science, and an underpinning methodology in many domains of science, business and social science. Moreover, while remaining naturally entwined, the three arms of Bayesian statistics, namely modelling, computation and inference, have grown into independent research fields. While the research arms of Bayesian statistics continue to grow in many directions, they are harnessed when attention turns to solving substantive applied problems. Each such problem set has its own challenges and hence draws from the suite of research a bespoke solution.The book will be useful for both theoretical and applied statisticians, as well as practitioners, to inspect these solutions in the context of the problems, in order to draw further understanding, awareness and inspiration.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with the selection of subsets of predictor variables in a linear regression model for the prediction of a dependent variable. It is based on a Bayesian approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability distribution is first assigned to the dependent variable through the specification of a family of prior distributions for the unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere, that is, a ``spike and slab'' distribution. The random error component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation {$\sigma$}, where ln({$\sigma$}) has a locally uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior distribution depends only on the data and the parameter {$\gamma$}, which is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods. Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing {$\gamma$}, assessing the complexity of the response function and the strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following plots against {$\gamma$} are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e) posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that generates a predictive density for each observation, given all of the data except that observation, that is, a type of ``leave one out'' approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a specified level of significance. The dependence of the results on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are given to demonstrate the application of the methods.},

The accompanying software can be run by remote Internet users. The supporting web-sites include software for Java, C++, and other lan\- guages.

The techniques are evaluated in the spirit of the average rather than the worst case analysis. In this context, "heuristics" are understood to be an expert opinion defining how to solve a family of problems of dis\- crete or global optimization. The term "Bayesian Heuristic Approach" means that one defines a set of heuristics and fixes some prior distribu\- tion on the results obtained. By applying BHA one is looking for the heuristic that reduces the average deviation from the global optimum. The theoretical discussions serve as an introduction to examples that are the main part of the book. All the examples are interconnected. Dif\- ferent examples illustrate different points of the general subject. How\- ever, one can consider each example separately, too.},

  abstract = {Several schemes for the linear mapping of a multidimensional space have been proposed for various applications, such as access methods for spatio-temporal databases and image compression. In these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best clustering (Abel and Mark, 1990; Jagadish, 1990). We analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space-filling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work. They agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hypersurface area of the query region and not on its hypervolume. We also show that the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve. From a practical point of view, the formulas given provide a simple measure that can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and, hence, the total access time.},

All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package\textemdash PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)\textemdash that is freely available online.

A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

The importance of this paper, containing a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear op\- timization problems, was not only in its complexity bound. At that time, the most surprising feature of this algorithm was that the theoretical pre\- diction of its high efficiency was supported by excellent computational results. This unusual fact dramatically changed the style and direc\- tions of the research in nonlinear optimization. Thereafter it became more and more common that the new methods were provided with a complexity analysis, which was considered a better justification of their efficiency than computational experiments. In a new rapidly develop\- ing field, which got the name "polynomial-time interior-point methods", such a justification was obligatory. Afteralmost fifteen years of intensive research, the main results of this development started to appear in monographs [12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Approximately at that time the author was asked to prepare a new course on nonlinear optimization for graduate students. The idea was to create a course which would reflect the new developments in the field. Actually, this was a major challenge. At the time only the theory of interior-point methods for linear optimization was polished enough to be explained to students. The general theory of self-concordant functions had appeared in print only once in the form of research monograph [12].},

Methods based on fully parametric mixture models are available, but lack of fit in some examples indicates that more flexible models may be beneficial. Existing, more flexible, mixture models work at the level of one-dimensional gene-specific summary statistics, and so when there are relatively few measurements per gene these methods may not provide sensitive detectors of differential expression. We propose a hierarchical mixture model to provide methodology that is both sensitive in detecting differential expression and sufficiently flexible to account for the complex variability of normalized microarray data. EM-based algorithms are used to fit both parametric and semiparametric versions of the model. We restrict attention to the two-sample comparison problem; an experiment involving Affymetrix microarrays and yeast translation provides the motivating case study. Gene-specific posterior probabilities of differential expression form the basis of statistical inference; they define short gene lists and false discovery rates. Compared to several competing methodologies, the proposed methodology exhibits good operating characteristics in a simulation study, on the analysis of spike-in data, and in a cross-validation calculation.},

  abstract = {Empirically analyzing empirical evidence One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {$<$} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects. Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.

  abstract = {In this book, an integrated introduction to statistical inference is provided from a frequentist likelihood-based viewpoint. Classical results are presented together with recent developments, largely built upon ideas due to R.A. Fisher. The term "neo-Fisherian" highlights this.After a unified review of background material (statistical models, likelihood, data and model reduction, first-order asymptotics) and inference in the presence of nuisance parameters (including pseudo-likelihoods), a self-contained introduction is given to exponential families, exponential dispersion models, generalized linear models, and group families. Finally, basic results of higher-order asymptotics are introduced (index notation, asymptotic expansions for statistics and distributions, and major applications to likelihood inference).The emphasis is more on general concepts and methods than on regularity conditions. Many examples are given for specific statistical models. Each chapter is supplemented with problems and bibliographic notes. This volume can serve as a textbook in intermediate-level undergraduate and postgraduate courses in statistical inference.},

  abstract = {Wasserstein distances are metrics on probability distributions inspired by the problem of optimal mass transportation. Roughly speaking, they measure the minimal effort required to reconfigure the probability mass of one distribution in order to recover the other distribution. They are ubiquitous in mathematics, with a long history that has seen them catalyse core developments in analysis, optimization, and probability. Beyond their intrinsic mathematical richness, they possess attractive features that make them a versatile tool for the statistician: they can be used to derive weak convergence and convergence of moments, and can be easily bounded; they are well-adapted to quantify a natural notion of perturbation of a probability distribution; and they seamlessly incorporate the geometry of the domain of the distributions in question, thus being useful for contrasting complex objects. Consequently, they frequently appear in the development of statistical theory and inferential methodology, and have recently become an object of inference in themselves. In this review, we provide a snapshot of the main concepts involved in Wasserstein distances and optimal transportation, and a succinct overview of some of their many statistical aspects.},

There are, however, numerous contexts of considerable scientific interest in which the natural supports for the data under consideration are Riemannian manifolds like the unit circle, torus, sphere and their extensions. Typically, such data can be represented using one or more directions, and directional statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with their analysis. In this paper we provide a review of the many recent developments in the field since the publication of Mardia and Jupp (1999), still the most comprehensive text on directional statistics. Many of those developments have been stimulated by interesting applications in fields as diverse as astronomy, medicine, genetics, neurology, aeronautics, acoustics, image analysis, text mining, environmetrics, and machine learning. We begin by considering developments for the exploratory analysis of directional data before progressing to distributional models, general approaches to inference, hypothesis testing, regression, nonparametric curve estimation, methods for dimension reduction, classification and clustering, and the modelling of time series, spatial, and spatio-temporal data. We end with an overview of presently available software for analyzing directional data.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words of the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications.},

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

We argue that in many cases one can benefit from a decision theoretically justified two-stage approach: first, construct a possibly non-sparse model that predicts well, and then find a minimal subset of features that characterize the predictions. The model built in the first step is referred to as the \textbackslash emph\{reference model\} and the operation during the latter step as predictive \textbackslash emph\{projection\}. The key characteristic of this approach is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between sparsity and predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from utilizing all available information including prior and that coming from the left out features. We review several methods that follow this principle and provide novel methodological contributions. We present a new projection technique that unifies two existing techniques and is both accurate and fast to compute. We also propose a way of evaluating the feature selection process using fast leave-one-out cross-validation that allows for easy and intuitive model size selection. Furthermore, we prove a theorem that helps to understand the conditions under which the projective approach could be beneficial. The benefits are illustrated via several simulated and real world examples.},

The usual Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a single parameter \$\textbackslash theta\$, introduced by Kingman, is \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(0, \textbackslash theta)\$. Known properties of \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(0, \textbackslash theta)\$, including the Markov chain description due to Vershik, Shmidt and Ignatov, are generalized to the two-parameter case. The size-biased random permutation of \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha, \textbackslash theta)\$ is a simple residual allocation model proposed by Engen in the context of species diversity, and rediscovered by Perman and the authors in the study of excursions of Brownian motion and Bessel processes. For \$0 {$<$} \textbackslash alpha {$<$} 1, \textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha, 0)\$ is the asymptotic distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a Markov chain away from a state whose recurrence time distribution is in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index \$\textbackslash alpha\$. Formulae in this case trace back to work of Darling, Lamperti and Wendel in the 1950s and 1960s. The distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a one-dimensional Brownian motion is \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(1/2, 0)\$, and the corresponding distribution for a Brownian bredge is \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(1/2, 1/2)\$. The \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha, 0)\$ and \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha, \textbackslash alpha)\$ distributions admit a similar interpretation in terms of the ranked lengths of excursions of a semistable Markov process whose zero set is the range of a stable subordinator of index \$\textbackslash alpha\$.},

  abstract = {Additive-interactive regression has recently been shown to offer attractive minimax error rates over traditional nonparametric multivariate regression in a wide variety of settings, including cases where the predictor count is much larger than the sample size and many of the predictors have important effects on the response, potentially through complex interactions. We present a Bayesian implementation of additive-interactive regression using an additive Gaussian process (AGP) prior and develop an efficient Markov chain sampler that extends stochastic search variable selection in this setting. Careful prior and hyper-parameter specification are developed in light of performance and computational considerations, and key innovations address difficulties in exploring a joint posterior distribution over multiple subsets of high dimensional predictor inclusion vectors. The method offers state-of-the-art support and interaction recovery while improving dramatically over competitors in terms of prediction accuracy on a diverse set of simulated and real data. Results from real data studies provide strong evidence that the additive-interactive framework is an attractive modeling platform for high-dimensional nonparametric regression.},

  abstract = {A major tool for quality control and management, statistical process control (SPC) monitors sequential processes, such as production lines and Internet traffic, to ensure that they work stably and satisfactorily. Along with covering traditional methods, Introduction to Statistical Process Control describes many recent SPC methods that improve upon the more established techniques. The author\textemdash a leading researcher on SPC\textemdash shows how these methods can handle new applications.After exploring the role of SPC and other statistical methods in quality control and management, the book covers basic statistical concepts and methods useful in SPC. It then systematically describes traditional SPC charts, including the Shewhart, CUSUM, and EWMA charts, as well as recent control charts based on change-point detection and fundamental multivariate SPC charts under the normality assumption. The text also introduces novel univariate and multivariate control charts for cases when the normality assumption is invalid and discusses control charts for profile monitoring. All computations in the examples are solved using R, with R functions and datasets available for download on the author's website. Offering a systematic description of both traditional and newer SPC methods, this book is ideal as a primary textbook for a one-semester course in disciplines concerned with process quality control, such as statistics, industrial and systems engineering, and management sciences. It can also be used as a supplemental textbook for courses on quality improvement and system management. In addition, the book provides researchers with many useful, recent research results on SPC and gives quality control practitioners helpful guidelines on implementing up-to-date SPC techniques.},

  abstract = {``Big data'' is a buzzword these days due to an enormous amount of data-rich applications in different industries and research projects. In practice, big data often take the form of data streams in the sense that new batches of data keep being collected over time. One fundamental research problem when analyzing big data in a given application is to monitor the underlying sequential process of the observed data to see whether it is longitudinally stable, or how its distribution changes over time. To monitor a sequential process, one major statistical tool is the statistical process control (SPC) charts, which have been developed and used mainly for monitoring production lines in the manufacturing industries during the past several decades. With many new and versatile SPC methods developed in the recent research, it is our belief that SPC can become a powerful tool for handling many big data applications that are beyond the production line monitoring. In this article, we introduce some recent SPC methods, and discuss their potential to solve some big data problems. Certain challenges in the interface between the current SPC research and some big data applications are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Spatial boundary analysis has attained considerable attention in several disciplines including engineering, shape analysis, spatial statistics, and computer science. The inferential question of interest is often to identify rapid surface change of an unobserved latent process. Curvilinear wombling and crisp wombling (or fuzzy) are two major approaches that have emerged in Bayesian spatial statistics literature. These methods are limited to a single spatial scale even though data with multiple spatial scales are often accessible. Thus, we propose a multiscale representation of the directional derivative Karhunen\textendash Lo\'eve expansion to perform directionally based boundary detection. Taking a multiscale spatial perspective allows us, for the first time, to consider the concept of curvilinear boundary fallacy (CBF) error, which is a boundary detection analog to the ecological fallacy that is often studied in spatial change of support literature. Furthermore, we propose a directionally based multiscale curvilinear boundary error criterion to quantify CBF. We refer to this metric as the criterion for boundary aggregation error (BAGE), and use it to perform boundary detection. Several theoretical results are derived to motivate BAGE. In particular, we show that no BAGE exists when the directional derivatives of eigenfunctions of a KL expansion are constant across spatial scales. We illustrate the use of our model through a simulated example and an analysis of Mediterranean wind measurements data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modeling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors' own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other recent volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.

However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires significant model-specific analysis, and these efforts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand. In this paper, we present a "black box" variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation. Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.},

What is the future of statistics in the present millennium dominated by information technology encompassing the whole of communications, interaction with intelligent systems, massive data bases, and complex information processing networks?

  abstract = {This paper outlines a framework for quantifying the prior's contribution to posterior inference in the presence of prior-likelihood discordance, a broader concept than the usual notion of prior-likelihood conflict. We achieve this dual purpose by extending the classic notion of prior sample size, M, in three directions: (I) estimating M beyond conjugate families; (II) formulating M as a relative notion that is as a function of the likelihood sample size k, M(k), which also leads naturally to a graphical diagnosis; and (III) permitting negative M, as a measure of prior-likelihood conflict, that is, harmful discordance. Our asymptotic regime permits the prior sample size to grow with the likelihood data size, hence making asymptotic arguments meaningful for investigating the impact of the prior relative to that of likelihood. It leads to a simple asymptotic formula for quantifying the impact of a proper prior that only involves computing a centrality and a spread measure of the prior and the posterior. We use simulated and real data to illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, including quantifying how weak is a `weakly informative' prior adopted in a study of lupus nephritis. Whereas we take a pragmatic perspective in assessing the impact of a prior on a given inference problem under a specific evaluative metric, we also touch upon conceptual and theoretical issues such as using improper priors and permitting priors with asymptotically non-vanishing influence.},

The main focus of this article is on a type of VSR control chart called a variable sampling interval (VSI) control chart, but another type of VSR control chart based on sequential sampling is also considered. We consider the problem of detecting sustained or transient shifts in the mean or variability of a process. We investigate Shewhart control charts and multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control charts based on sample means and on the sum of the squared deviations from target. We show that the combination of the standard MEWMA chart and an MEWMA-type chart based on squared deviations from target gives excellent overall performance. When the VSI feature is used with this combination, the performance is dramatically better than the performance of the standard FSR multivariate control charts that have traditionally been used.},

  abstract = {t-SNE and hierarchical clustering are popular methods of exploratory data analysis, particularly in biology. Building on recent advances in speeding up t-SNE and obtaining finer-grained structure, we combine the two to create tree-SNE, a hierarchical clustering and visualization algorithm based on stacked one-dimensional t-SNE embeddings. We also introduce alpha-clustering, which recommends the optimal cluster assignment, without foreknowledge of the number of clusters, based off of the cluster stability across multiple scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of tree-SNE and alpha-clustering on images of handwritten digits, mass cytometry (CyTOF) data from blood cells, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from retinal cells. Furthermore, to demonstrate the validity of the visualization, we use alpha-clustering to obtain unsupervised clustering results competitive with the state of the art on several image data sets.

These topics are developed around a decreasing chain of classes of distributions Lm, m = 0,1,...,{$\infty$}, from the class L0 of selfdecomposable distributions to the class L{$\infty$} generated by stable distributions through convolution and convergence.The book is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 studies basic properties of Lm classes needed for the subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 introduces Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type processes generated by a L\'evy process through stochastic integrals based on L\'evy processes. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a generating L\'evy process so that the OU type process has a limit distribution of Lm class.Chapter 3 establishes the correspondence between selfsimilar additive processes and selfdecomposable distributions and makes a close inspection of the Lamperti transformation, which transforms selfsimilar additive processes and stationary type OU processes to each other. Chapter 4 studies multivariate subordination of a cone-parameter L\'evy process by a cone-valued L\'evy process. Finally, Chapter 5 studies strictly stable and Lm properties inherited by the subordinated process in multivariate subordination.In this revised edition, new material is included on advances in these topics. It is rewritten as self-contained as possible. Theorems, lemmas, propositions, examples and remarks were reorganized; some were deleted and others were newly added. The historical notes at the end of each chapter were enlarged.This book is addressed to graduate students and researchers in probability and mathematical statistics who are interested in learning more on L\'evy processes and infinitely divisible distributions.},

  abstract = {Since their inception in the 1980's, regression trees have been one of the more widely used non-parametric prediction methods. Tree-structured methods yield a histogram reconstruction of the regression surface, where the bins correspond to terminal nodes of recursive partitioning. Trees are powerful, yet susceptible to over-fitting. Strategies against overfitting have traditionally relied on pruning greedily grown trees. The Bayesian framework offers an alternative remedy against overfitting through priors. Roughly speaking, a good prior charges smaller trees where overfitting does not occur. While the consistency of random histograms, trees and their ensembles has been studied quite extensively, the theoretical understanding of the Bayesian counterparts has been missing. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding why/when do Bayesian trees and their ensembles not overfit. To address this question, we study the speed at which the posterior concentrates around the true smooth regression function. We propose a spike-and-tree variant of the popular Bayesian CART prior and establish new theoretical results showing that regression trees (and their ensembles) (a) are capable of recovering smooth regression surfaces, achieving optimal rates up to a log factor, (b) can adapt to the unknown level of smoothness and (c) can perform effective dimension reduction when p{$>$}n. These results provide a piece of missing theoretical evidence explaining why Bayesian trees (and additive variants thereof) have worked so well in practice.},

Social networks, representing people who communicate with each other, are one example. Communities or clusters of highly connected actors form an essential feature in the structure of several empirical networks. Spectral clustering is a popular and computationally feasible method to discover these communities. The stochastic blockmodel [Social Networks 5 (1983) 109\textendash 137] is a social network model with well-defined communities; each node is a member of one community. For a network generated from the Stochastic Blockmodel, we bound the number of nodes ``misclustered'' by spectral clustering. The asymptotic results in this paper are the first clustering results that allow the number of clusters in the model to grow with the number of nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. In order to study spectral clustering under the stochastic blockmodel, we first show that under the more general latent space model, the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian asymptotically converge to the eigenvectors of a ``population'' normalized graph Laplacian. Aside from the implication for spectral clustering, this provides insight into a graph visualization technique. Our method of studying the eigenvectors of random matrices is original.},

  abstract = {The most prevalent approach to activation localization in neuroimaging is to identify brain regions as contiguous supra-threshold clusters, check their significance using random field theory, and correct for the multiple clusters being tested. Besides recent criticism on the validity of the random field assumption, a spatial specificity paradox remains: the larger the detected cluster, the less we know about the location of activation within that cluster. This is because cluster inference implies ``there exists at least one voxel with an evoked response in the cluster'', and not that ``all the voxels in the cluster have an evoked response''. Inference on voxels within selected clusters is considered bad practice, due to the voxel-wise false positive rate inflation associated with this circular inference. Here, we propose a remedy to the spatial specificity paradox. By applying recent results from the multiple testing statistical literature, we are able to quantify the proportion of truly active voxels within selected clusters, an approach we call All-Resolutions Inference (ARI). If this proportion is high, the paradox vanishes. If it is low, we can further ``drill down'' from the cluster level to sub-regions, and even to individual voxels, in order to pinpoint the origin of the activation. In fact, ARI allows inference on the proportion of activation in all voxel sets, no matter how large or small, however these have been selected, all from the same data. We use two fMRI datasets to demonstrate the non-triviality of the spatial specificity paradox, and its resolution using ARI. We verify that the endless circularity permitted by ARI does not render its estimates overly conservative using both simulation, and a data split.},

Working in this area is like skating on the edge of reason. Unfortunately, no comprehensive treatment has ever been attempted other than the gallant effort by W. Sierpiriski in 1912. At that time, the subject was still in its infancy and the most interesting and perplexing results were still to come. Besides, Sierpiriski's paper was written in Polish and published in a journal that is not readily accessible (Sierpiriski [2]). Most of the early literature on the subject is in French, German, and Polish, providing an additional raison d'etre for a comprehensive treatment in English. While there was, understandably, some intensive research activity on this subject around the turn of the century, contributions have, nevertheless, continued up to the present and there is no end in sight, indicating that the subject is still very much alive. The recent interest in fractals has refocused interest on space\- filling curves, and the study of fractals has thrown some new light on this small but venerable part of mathematics. This monograph is neither a textbook nor an encyclopedic treatment of the subject nor a historical account, but it is a little of each. While it may lend structure to a seminar or pro-seminar, or be useful as a supplement in a course on topology or mathematical analysis, it is primarily intended for self-study by the aficionados of classical analysis.},

To achieve good performance, several formats may need to be used in one program, requiring explicit selection and conversion between the formats. This can be both tedious and error-prone, especially for non-expert users. Motivated by this issue, we present a user-friendly sparse matrix class for the C++ language, with a high-level application programming interface deliberately similar to the widely used MATLAB language. The class internally uses two main approaches to achieve efficient execution: (i) a hybrid storage framework, which automatically and seamlessly switches between three underlying storage formats (compressed sparse column, coordinate list, Red-Black tree) depending on which format is best suited for specific operations, and (ii) template-based meta-programming to automatically detect and optimise execution of common expression patterns. To facilitate relatively quick conversion of research code into production environments, the class and its associated functions provide a suite of essential sparse linear algebra functionality (eg., arithmetic operations, submatrix manipulation) as well as high-level functions for sparse eigendecompositions and linear equation solvers. The latter are achieved by providing easy-to-use abstractions of the low-level ARPACK and SuperLU libraries.

In particular, they are generally trained using a closed-form solution of the (regularized) least-squares approach. This paper introduces several alternative strategies for performing full Bayesian inference (BI) of RVFL networks. Distinct from standard or classical approaches, our proposed Bayesian training algorithms allow to derive an entire probability distribution over the optimal output weights of the network, instead of a single pointwise estimate according to some given criterion (e.g., least-squares). This provides several known advantages, including the possibility of introducing additional prior knowledge in the training process, the availability of an uncertainty measure during the test phase, and the capability of automatically inferring hyper-parameters from given data. In this paper, two BI algorithms for regression are first proposed that, under some practical assumptions, can be implemented by a simple iterative process with closed-form computations. Simulation results show that one of the proposed algorithms, Bayesian RVFL, is able to outperform standard training algorithms for RVFL networks with a proper regularization factor selected carefully via a line search procedure. A general strategy based on variational inference is also presented, with an application to data modeling problems with noisy outputs or outliers. As we discuss in this paper, using recent advances in automatic differentiation this strategy can be applied to a wide range of additional situations in an immediate fashion.},

  abstract = {If you think that statistics has nothing to say about what you do or how you could do it better, then you are either wrong or in need of a more interesting job. Stephen Senn explains here how statistics determines many decisions about medical care--from allocating resources for health, to determining which drugs to license, to cause-and-effect in relation to disease. He tackles big themes: clinical trials and the development of medicines, life tables, vaccines and their risks or lack of them, smoking and lung cancer and even the power of prayer. He entertains with puzzles and paradoxes and covers the lives of famous statistical pioneers. By the end of the book the reader will see how reasoning with probability is essential to making rational decisions in medicine, and how and when it can guide us when faced with choices that impact our health and/or life. Stephen Senn has been a Professor of Pharmaceutical and Health Statistics at the University College of London since 1995. In 2001 he won George C. Challis Award of the University of Florida for contributions to biostatistics.

One is the recognition that it is desirable to condition on relevant ancillary statistics. Another is that probability approximations are based on saddlepoint and closely related approximations that generally have very high accuracy. A third aspect is that, for models with nuisance parameters, inference is often based on marginal or conditional likelihoods, or approximations to these likelihoods. These methods have been shown often to yield substantial improvements over classical methods. The book also provides an up-to-date account of recent results in the field, which has been undergoing rapid development.},

  abstract = {In this article, we consider the problem of monitoring Poisson rates when the population sizes are time-varying and the nominal value of the process parameter is unavailable. Almost all previous control schemes for the detection of increases in the Poisson rate in Phase II are constructed based on assumed knowledge of the process parameters, for example, the expectation of the count of a rare event when the process of interest is in control. In practice, however, this parameter is usually unknown and not able to be estimated with a sufficiently large number of reference samples. A self-starting exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control scheme based on a parametric bootstrap method is proposed. The success of the proposed method lies in the use of probability control limits, which are determined based on the observations during rather than before monitoring. Simulation studies show that our proposed scheme has good in-control and out-of-control performance under various situations. In particular, our proposed scheme is useful in rare event studies during the start-up stage of a monitoring process. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

For the very first time in a single volume, the Handbook of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) presents an extensive overview of the theory, practice and application of ABC methods. These simple, but powerful statistical techniques, take Bayesian statistics beyond the need to specify overly simplified models, to the setting where the model is defined only as a process that generates data. This process can be arbitrarily complex, to the point where standard Bayesian techniques based on working with tractable likelihood functions would not be viable. ABC methods finesse the problem of model complexity within the Bayesian framework by exploiting modern computational power, thereby permitting approximate Bayesian analyses of models that would otherwise be impossible to implement. The Handbook of ABC provides illuminating insight into the world of Bayesian modelling for intractable models for both experts and newcomers alike. It is an essential reference book for anyone interested in learning about and implementing ABC techniques to analyse complex models in the modern world.},

  abstract = {Stochastic approximation (SA) has long been applied for problems of minimizing loss functions or root finding with noisy input information. As with all stochastic search algorithms, there are adjustable algorithm coefficients that must be specified, and that can have a profound effect on algorithm performance. It is known that choosing these coefficients according to an SA analog of the deterministic Newton-Raphson algorithm provides an optimal or near-optimal form of the algorithm. However, directly determining the required Hessian matrix (or Jacobian matrix for root finding) to achieve this algorithm form has often been difficult or impossible in practice. The paper presents a general adaptive SA algorithm that is based on a simple method for estimating the Hessian matrix, while concurrently estimating the primary parameters of interest. The approach applies in both the gradient-free optimization (Kiefer-Wolfowitz) and root-finding/stochastic gradient-based (Robbins-Monro) settings, and is based on the "simultaneous perturbation (SP)" idea introduced previously. The algorithm requires only a small number of loss function or gradient measurements per iteration-independent of the problem dimension-to adaptively estimate the Hessian and parameters of primary interest. Aside from introducing the adaptive SP approach, the paper presents practical implementation guidance, asymptotic theory, and a nontrivial numerical evaluation. Also included is a discussion and numerical analysis comparing the adaptive SP approach with the iterate-averaging approach to accelerated SA.},

First, data are divided into smaller computationally tractable subsets. Second, posterior draws of parameters are obtained for every subset after modifying subset posteriors using stochastic approximation. Finally, the empirical measures of samples from each subset posterior are combined through their barycenter in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. Stochastic approximation ensures that posterior uncertainty quantification of the barycenter matches with that of the full data posterior distribution. The combining step can be conducted efficiently through a sparse linear program, which takes negligible time relative to sampling from subset posteriors, facilitating scaling to massive data. WASP is very general and allows application of existing sampling algorithms to massive data with minimal modifications. We provide theoretical conditions under which rate of convergence of WASP to the delta measure centered at the true parameter coincides with the optimal parametric rate up to a logarithmic factor. WASP is applied for scalable Bayesian computations in a nonparametric mixture model and a movie recommender database containing tens of millions of ratings.},

In this paper we focus on developing a novel family of multiscale stick-breaking mixture models that inherits some of the advantages of both single-scale nonparametric mixtures and P\'olya trees. Our proposal is based on a mixture specification exploiting an infinitely deep binary tree of random weights that grows according to a multiscale generalization of a large class of stick-breaking processes; this multiscale stick-breaking is paired with specific stochastic processes generating sequences of parameters that induce stochastically ordered kernel functions. Properties of this family of multiscale stick-breaking mixtures are described. Focusing on a Gaussian specification, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior computation is introduced. The performance of the method is illustrated analyzing both synthetic and real datasets consistently showing competitive results both in scenarios favoring single-scale and multiscale methods. The results suggest that the method is well suited to estimate densities with varying degree of smoothness and local features.},

The efficiency of a stratification technique mainly depends on the coherence of the strata. This paper presents an approach to generate an arbitrary number of coherent strata, independently of the dimensionality of the domain, using the Hilbert space-filling curve. Using this approach, it is possible to draw an arbitrary number of stratified samples from higher dimensional spaces using only one-dimensional stratification.

Our key innovation involves the representation of the pattern of links between records as a bipartite graph, in which records are directly linked to latent true individuals, and only indirectly linked to other records. This flexible representation of the linkage structure naturally allows us to estimate the attributes of the unique observable people in the population, calculate transitive linkage probabilities across records (and represent this visually), and propagate the uncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our method makes it particularly easy to integrate record linkage with post-processing procedures such as logistic regression, capture-recapture, etc. Our linkage structure lends itself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously record linkage approaches, despite the high-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate our method using longitudinal data from the National Long Term Care Survey and with data from the Italian Survey on Household and Wealth, where we assess the accuracy of our method and show it to be better in terms of error rates and empirical scalability than other approaches in the literature.},

This paper introduces the Fuzzy C-means++ algorithm which, by utilizing the seeding mechanism of the K-means++ algorithm, improves the effectiveness and speed of Fuzzy C-means. By careful seeding that disperses the initial cluster centers through the data space, the resulting Fuzzy C-means++ approach samples starting cluster representatives during the initialization phase. The cluster representatives are well spread in the input space, resulting in both faster convergence times and higher quality solutions. Implementations in R of standard Fuzzy C-means and Fuzzy C-means++ are evaluated on various data sets. We investigate the cluster quality and iteration count as we vary the spreading factor on a series of synthetic data sets. We run the algorithm on real world data sets and to account for the non-determinism inherent in these algorithms we record multiple runs while choosing different k parameter values. The results show that the proposed method gives significant improvement in convergence times (the number of iterations) of up to 40 (2.1 on average) times the standard on synthetic datasets and, in general, an associated lower cost function value and Xie\textendash Beni value. A proof sketch of the logarithmically bounded expected cost function value is given.},

It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.},

This new edition of Wilson Sutherland's classic text introduces metric and topological spaces by describing some of that influence. The aim is to move gradually from familiar real analysis to abstract topological spaces, using metric spaces as a bridge between the two. The language of metric and topological spaces is established with continuity as the motivating concept. Several concepts are introduced, first in metric spaces and then repeated for topological spaces, to help convey familiarity. The discussion develops to cover connectedness, compactness and completeness, a trio widely used in the rest of mathematics. Topology also has a more geometric aspect which is familiar in popular expositions of the subject as `rubber-sheet geometry', with pictures of M\"obius bands, doughnuts, Klein bottles and the like; this geometric aspect is illustrated by describing some standard surfaces, and it is shown how all this fits into the same story as the more analytic developments. The book is primarily aimed at second- or third-year mathematics students. There are numerous exercises, many of the more challenging ones accompanied by hints, as well as a companion website, with further explanations and examples as well as material supplementary to that in the book.},

Median power to detect small, medium, and large effects was 0.12, 0.44, and 0.73, reflecting no improvement through the past half-century. This is so because sample sizes have remained small. Assuming similar true effect sizes in both disciplines, power was lower in cognitive neuroscience than in psychology. Journal impact factors negatively correlated with power. Assuming a realistic range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, false report probability is likely to exceed 50\% for the whole literature. In light of our findings, the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic, and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.},

In Snijders and Nowicki (1997) and Nowicki and Snijders (2001), a Bayesian approach to blockmodels is presented, where the probability of a relation between two actors depends only on the classes to which the actors belong but is independent of the actors. When actors are a priori partitioned into subsets based on actor attributes such as race, sex and income, the model proposed by Nowicki and Snijders completely ignores this extra piece of information. In this paper, a blockmodel that is a simple extension of their model is proposed specifically for such data. The class affiliation probabilities are modeled conditional on the actor attributes via a multinomial probit model. Posterior distributions of the model parameters, and predictive posterior distributions of the class affiliation probabilities are computed by using a straightforward Gibbs sampling algorithm. Applications are illustrated with analysis on real and simulated data sets},

First, the statistical model is built up on the actually observed categorical variables and no reduction (to 0\textendash 1 comparisons) of the available information takes place. Second, the hierarchical structure of the model allows a two-way propagation of the uncertainty between the parameter estimation step and the matching procedure so that no plug-in estimates are used and the correct uncertainty is accounted for both in estimating the population size and in performing the record linkage. We illustrate and motivate our proposal through a real data example and simulations.},

Recently, it has been extended to monitoring surgical outcomes. Unlike a manufacturing process where the raw material is usually reasonably homogeneous, patients' risks of surgical failure are usually different. It has been proposed in the literature that the binary outcomes from a surgical procedure be adjusted using the preoperative risk based on a likelihood-ratio scoring method. Such a crude classification of surgical outcome is naive. It is unreasonable to regard a patient who has a full recovery, the same quality outcome as another patient who survived but remained bed-ridden for life. For a patient who survives an operation, there can be many different grades of recovery. Thus, it makes sense to consider a risk-adjusted cumulative sum charting procedure based on more than two outcomes to better monitor surgical performance. In this article, we develop such a chart and study its performance.},

We hypothesize that the local immune micro-environment of NSCLC is associated with patient outcomes and that these local immune features exhibit distinct radiologic characteristics discernible by quantitative imaging metrics. We assembled two cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with definitive surgical resection and extracted quantitative parameters from pretreatment CT imaging. The excised primary tumors were then quantified for percent tumor PDL1 expression and density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (via CD3 count) utilizing immunohistochemistry and automated cell counting. Associating these pretreatment radiomics parameters with tumor immune parameters, we developed an immune pathology-informed model (IPIM) that separated patients into 4 clusters (designated A-D) utilizing 4 radiomics features. The IPIM designation was significantly associated with overall survival in both training (5 year OS: 61\%, 41\%, 50\%, and 91\%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P\,=\,0.04) and validation (5 year OS: 55\%, 72\%, 75\%, and 86\%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P\,=\,0.002) cohorts and immune pathology (all P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Specifically, we identified a favorable outcome group characterized by low CT intensity and high heterogeneity that exhibited low PDL1 and high CD3 infiltration, suggestive of a favorable immune activated state. We have developed a NSCLC radiomics signature based on the immune micro-environment and patient outcomes. This manuscript demonstrates model creation and validation in independent cohorts.},

There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem.  This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field. This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. The book sharpens the reader's intuition on how to think about missing data, and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data.},

Penalized regression overcomes this non-identifiability by augmentation of the loss function by a penalty (i.e. a function of regression coefficients). The ridge penalty is the sum of squared regression coefficients, giving rise to ridge regression. Here many aspect of ridge regression are reviewed e.g. moments, mean squared error, its equivalence to constrained estimation, and its relation to Bayesian regression. Finally, its behaviour and use are illustrated in simulation and on omics data. Subsequently, ridge regression is generalized to allow for a more general penalty. The ridge penalization framework is then translated to logistic regression and its properties are shown to carry over. To contrast ridge penalized estimation, the final chapter introduces its lasso counterpart.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

While being conceptually and computationally appealing, this method involves the problematic need to also split the prior for the local inferences; these weakened priors may not provide enough regularization for each separate computation, thus eliminating one of the key advantages of Bayesian methods. To resolve this dilemma while still retaining the generalizability of the underlying local inference method, we apply the idea of expectation propagation (EP) as a framework for distributed Bayesian inference. The central idea is to iteratively update approximations to the local likelihoods given the state of the other approximations and the prior. The present paper has two roles: we review the steps that are needed to keep EP algorithms numerically stable, and we suggest a general approach, inspired by EP, for approaching data partitioning problems in a way that achieves the computational benefits of parallelism while allowing each local update to make use of relevant information from the other sites. In addition, we demonstrate how the method can be applied in a hierarchical context to make use of partitioning of both data and parameters. The paper describes a general algorithmic framework, rather than a specific algorithm, and presents an example implementation for it.},

It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas that have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S environments to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S and a course in modern statistical methods. Implementations of S are available commercially in S-PLUS(R) workstations and as the Open Source R for a wide range of computer systems. The aim of this book is to show how to use S as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book is intended for would-be users of S-PLUS or R and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state of the art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis, pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This fourth edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 6.0 or R 1.5.0 or later. A substantial change from the third edition is updating for the current versions of S-PLUS and adding coverage of R. The introductory material has been rewritten to emphasis the import, export and manipulation of data.

  abstract = {It is common practice to compare the fit of non-nested models using the Akaike (AIC) or Bayesian (BIC) information criteria. The basis of these criteria is the log-likelihood evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown parameters. For the general linear model (and the linear mixed model, which is a special case), estimation is usually carried out using residual or restricted maximum likelihood (REML). However, for models with different fixed effects, the residual likelihoods are not comparable and hence information criteria based on the residual likelihood cannot be used. For model selection, it is often suggested that the models are refitted using maximum likelihood to enable the criteria to be used. The first aim of this paper is to highlight that both the AIC and BIC can be used for the general linear model by using the full log-likelihood evaluated at the REML estimates. The second aim is to provide a derivation of the criteria under REML estimation. This aim is achieved by noting that the full likelihood can be decomposed into a marginal (residual) and conditional likelihood and this decomposition then incorporates aspects of both the fixed effects and variance parameters. Using this decomposition, the appropriate information criteria for model selection of models which differ in their fixed effects specification can be derived. An example is presented to illustrate the results and code is available for analyses using the ASReml-R package.},

Missing values can be filled in using multiple imputation, but imputation is tricky if the regression includes interactions, squares, or other transformations of the regressors. In this paper, we examine different approaches to imputing transformed variables; and we find one simple method that works well across a variety of circumstances. Our recommendation is to transform, then impute\textemdash i.e., calculate the interactions or squares in the incomplete data and then impute these transformations like any other variable. The transform-then-impute method yields good regression estimates, even though the imputed values are often inconsistent with one another. It is tempting to try and ``fix'' the inconsistencies in the imputed values, but methods that do so lead to biased regression estimates. Such biased methods include the passive imputation strategy implemented by the popular ice command for Stata.},

Wei focuses on high dimensional multivariate time series, and is illustrated with numerous high dimensional empirical time series. Beginning with the fundamentalconcepts and issues of multivariate time series analysis,this book covers many topics that are not found in general multivariate time series books. Some of these are repeated measurements, space-time series modelling, and dimension reduction. The book also looks at vector time series models, multivariate time series regression models, and principle component analysis of multivariate time series. Additionally, it provides readers with information on factor analysis of multivariate time series, multivariate GARCH models, and multivariate spectral analysis of time series. With the development of computers and the internet, we have increased potential for data exploration. In the next few years, dimension will become a more serious problem. Multivariate Time Series Analysis and its Applications provides some initial solutions, which may encourage the development of related software needed for the high dimensional multivariate time series analysis.  Written by bestselling author and leading expert in the field Covers topics not yet explored in current multivariate books Features classroom tested material Written specifically for time series courses  Multivariate Time Series Analysis and its Applications is designed for an advanced time series analysis course.

In its simplest form, frailty is an unobserved random proportionality factor that modifies the hazard function of an individual or a group of related individuals. Frailty Models in Survival Analysis presents a comprehensive overview of the fundamental approaches in the area of frailty models. The book extensively explores how univariate frailty models can represent unobserved heterogeneity. It also emphasizes correlated frailty models as extensions of univariate and shared frailty models. The author analyzes similarities and differences between frailty and copula models; discusses problems related to frailty models, such as tests for homogeneity; and describes parametric and semiparametric models using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. He also shows how to apply the models to real data using the statistical packages of R, SAS, and Stata. The appendix provides the technical mathematical results used throughout. Written in nontechnical terms accessible to nonspecialists, this book explains the basic ideas in frailty modeling and statistical techniques, with a focus on real-world data application and interpretation of the results. By applying several models to the same data, it allows for the comparison of their advantages and limitations under varying model assumptions. The book also employs simulations to analyze the finite sample size performance of the models.},

These chapters provide the foundational material for the remaining chapters, which cover the construction of structural models and the extension of vector autoregressive modeling to high frequency, continuously recorded, and irregularly sampled series. The final chapter combines these approaches with spectral methods for identifying causal dependence between time series.

  abstract = {Cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. However, cluster-extent based thresholding provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot make inferences about the statistical significance of specific locations within the cluster. This poses a particular problem when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e., higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. In such cases, it is impossible to reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. From a survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p{$<$}.01) is endemic, and that the largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default option in the software used. We illustrate the problems with liberal primary thresholds using an fMRI dataset from our laboratory (N=33), and present simulations demonstrating the detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false positives, localization, and interpretation of fMRI findings. To avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting procedures, including 1) setting primary p{$<$}.001 as a default lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3) adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial precision transparent to readers. We also suggest alternative and supplementary analysis methods.},

The chapters conclude with an application of the methods to the experiment, bridging the gap between theory and practice. The authors modernize accepted methodologies while refining many cutting-edge topics including robust parameter design, analysis of non-normal data, analysis of experiments with complex aliasing, multilevel designs, minimum aberration designs, and orthogonal arrays. The third edition includes:  Information on the design and analysis of computer experiments A discussion of practical optimal design of experiments An introduction to conditional main effect (CME) analysis and definitive screening designs (DSDs) New exercise problems  This book includes valuable exercises and problems, allowing the reader to gauge their progress and retention of the book's subject matter as they complete each chapter. Drawing on examples from their combined years of working with industrial clients, the authors present many cutting-edge topics in a single, easily accessible source. Extensive case studies, including goals, data, and experimental designs, are also included, and the book's data sets can be found on a related FTP site, along with additional supplemental material. Chapter summaries provide a succinct outline of discussed methods, and extensive appendices direct readers to resources for further study.

  abstract = {Since deep neural networks were developed, they have made huge contributions to everyday lives. Machine learning provides more rational advice than humans are capable of in almost every aspect of daily life. However, despite this achievement, the design and training of neural networks are still challenging and unpredictable procedures. To lower the technical thresholds for common users, automated hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) has become a popular topic in both academic and industrial areas. This paper provides a review of the most essential topics on HPO. The first section introduces the key hyper-parameters related to model training and structure, and discusses their importance and methods to define the value range. Then, the research focuses on major optimization algorithms and their applicability, covering their efficiency and accuracy especially for deep learning networks. This study next reviews major services and toolkits for HPO, comparing their support for state-of-the-art searching algorithms, feasibility with major deep learning frameworks, and extensibility for new modules designed by users. The paper concludes with problems that exist when HPO is applied to deep learning, a comparison between optimization algorithms, and prominent approaches for model evaluation with limited computational resources.},

Finite mixture models, Dirichlet process mixture models, and Pitman--Yor process mixture models make this assumption, as do all other infinitely exchangeable clustering models. However, for some applications, this assumption is inappropriate. For example, when performing entity resolution, the size of each cluster should be unrelated to the size of the data set, and each cluster should contain a negligible fraction of the total number of data points. These applications require models that yield clusters whose sizes grow sublinearly with the size of the data set. We address this requirement by defining the microclustering property and introducing a new class of models that can exhibit this property. We compare models within this class to two commonly used clustering models using four entity-resolution data sets.},

In practice, however, the use of a fixed control limit for the chart leads to a quite variable in-control average run length performance for patient populations with different risk score distributions. To overcome this problem, we determine simulation-based dynamic probability control limits (DPCLs) patient-by-patient for the risk-adjusted Bernoulli CUSUM charts. By maintaining the probability of a false alarm at a constant level conditional on no false alarm for previous observations, our risk-adjusted CUSUM charts with DPCLs have consistent in-control performance at the desired level with approximately geometrically distributed run lengths. Our simulation results demonstrate that our method does not rely on any information or assumptions about the patients' risk distributions. The use of DPCLs for risk-adjusted Bernoulli CUSUM charts allows each chart to be designed for the corresponding particular sequence of patients for a surgeon or hospital.

  abstract = {We introduce Pathfinder, a variational method for approximately sampling from differentiable log densities. Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors. Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL-divergence estimates are embarrassingly parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with multiple cores.},

The enlarging volumes of information emerging by the progress of technology, makes clustering of very large scale of data a challenging task. In order to deal with the problem, many researchers try to design efficient parallel clustering algorithms. In this paper, we propose a parallel k-means clustering algorithm based on MapReduce, which is a simple yet powerful parallel programming technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can scale well and efficiently process large datasets on commodity hardware.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the analysis of extreme rainfall data, we introduce a general Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the probability distribution of extreme values of intermittent random sequences, a common problem in geophysical and environmental science settings. The approach presented here relaxes the asymptotic assumption typical of the traditional extreme value (EV) theory, and accounts for the possible underlying variability in the distribution of event magnitudes and occurrences, which are described through a latent temporal process. Focusing on daily rainfall extremes, the structure of the proposed model lends itself to incorporating prior geo-physical understanding of the rainfall process. By means of an extensive simulation study, we show that this methodology can significantly reduce estimation uncertainty with respect to Bayesian formulations of traditional asymptotic EV methods, particularly in the case of relatively small samples. The benefits of the approach are further illustrated with an application to a large data set of 479 long daily rainfall historical records from across the continental United States. By comparing measures of in-sample and out-of-sample predictive accuracy, we find that the model structure developed here, combined with the use of all available observations for inference, significantly improves robustness with respect to overfitting to the specific sample.},

The SPC problem with a nonlinear profile is particularly challenging. This article proposes a novel scheme to monitor changes in both the regression relationship and the variation of the profile online. It integrates the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average procedure with the generalized likelihood ratio test based on nonparametric regression. The proposed scheme not only provides an effective SPC solution to handle nonlinear profiles, which are common in industrial practice, but it also resolves the latent problem in popular parametric monitoring methods of being unable to detect certain types of changes due to a misspecified, out-of-control model. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed monitoring scheme. In addition, a systematic diagnostic approach is provided to locate the change point of the process and identify the type of change in the profile. Finally, a deep reactive ion-etching example from semiconductor manufacturing is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed monitoring and diagnostic approach.},
